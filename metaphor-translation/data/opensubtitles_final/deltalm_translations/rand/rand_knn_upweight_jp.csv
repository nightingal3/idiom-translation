対人地雷禁止条約および クラスター爆弾禁止条約は 市民団体を関与させるという 従来の外交政策からの転換がなければ なしえなかったことでしょう,"We could never have done the convention against anti-personnel landmines and the convention that is banning cluster munitions unless we had done diplomacy differently , by engaging with civil society .","Well, I'm guessing the anti-personnel blast act and the Craster Anti-matter Act would have been suppressed from the traditional diplomatic policy that allowed civilians to be involved."
