All of a sudden, the natives were not only standing in the streets, shouting their deals, but they were taking them to negotiations, partly because they were representing the victims of these weapons.
How can we get away from the fact that we have a double plan, if we preach democracy and at the same time we don't want to deal with groups that are re-electional?
But for several years, I've studied the building of the problem of the Rem on the rem, and the Olympic field in the same city by the architects.
And with every animal that finds its own unique way of getting there, this tower becomes like a city with its own life, a place that lives with its micro-econ and its small business.
So, if we don't talk to these new groups that are going to rule the news over the next few years, we're going to step up the radicalization, I think.
We just have to persuade.
Another sign, that's the fact over the years, in the last few years, of the low number of all these domestic conflicts between states, and military conflicts that can be solved militaryly.
And how do we tell the Muslim Brotherhood, as we should, that they must respect the rights of the little people, if we don't accept the rights of the majority?
In a region known for the soft, porous soil of the Less plateau, until recently, it was estimated that there were 40 million people living in underground houses.
The international Red Cross committee, the squad, talks to everyone, and it does it because it's neutral.
So we spent more time focusing on reason to not talk to others than to figure out how to talk to others.
So, he's engaged a political process of histoire, not as a weak strategy, but as a force strategy.
And he's engaged in full-fledged talks by solving some of the most delicate issues through a truth and reconciling process where people have come and talked.
They can represent social, religious, political, economic, or military realities.
The way I see it, out of this decade is weakened, because we haven't understood the group.
When I first came to Afghanistan inaient, as Secretary of State, I met with the Commander of the FBI, the international troops.
And that's the reason why this organization is probably the best informed actor to understand modern conflicts-- because they exist.
Besides, over the last decade, we've been in a mode where treatment with groups was conceptally and politically dangerous.
Conversation isn't easy-- between individual, between groups, and between governments-- but it's really necessary.
I can't do that unless I send signals that I'll be listening to signals from the other side.
We know from personal experience that sometimes it's easy to retire, and sometimes you have to fight.
And I believe we need to strengthen this approach in modern diplomatic, not only between the states, but also within the states.
Together, the people created public spaces and designed them so that they would feel more like home and less like an unfinished tower.
Once on the water, it's clear that life is completely suited to these very specific living conditions.
It's the same in the villages.
Coke's success is important because if we can analyze it, learn from it, then we can save lives.
Most governments followed the volunteers of bossy leaders who were to stay away from these different groups, because they were terrorists.
And when the tension went up, they'd already had this conversation, and it was a force to deal with different issues.
Slowly, from found material, the walls rise up, and people create a space with no matter what object or material they find.
Even boats become shops where ladies live in a house to another, selling everything, fresh fruit toothpicks.
They were floating on the channels in a large lifeboat with a generator so the whole community could enjoy it.
But the situation is evolving, and we see that there are new key actors coming on the stage.
And the thing is, the last decade was so promising-- and mostly for a reason.
It's critical to understand, I believe, because of technology and because of globalization, the questionable society.
But the problem is we came out of a decade where we were afraid to touch it.
They were conceived in very specific ways by this group of people who have never done any design and design studies.
In this tradition, the bride lays all her possessions, which they will soon bring to her new husband.
Although their access to space and money is limited, the houses in this area are designed with care and detail.
The rules of engagement: how to talk, when to talk, and how to deal with them.
There may be a need to treat them with military means, but they can't be solved with military means.
They need a timely process where the real tissue of this very complicated society can deal with their problems.
Now, as you know, he didn't do this.
And we need to go beyond traditional diplomatic to the question of the survival of our time, global change.
What makes people trust each other, not only between the states, but also within the states?
But when you look closely, you see huge holes through which elevators and services would have worked.
During that evening I met this band of music on their thirty-one in their coordinated clothes.
We who are diplomatic, are trained to deal with conflicts between the states and matters between the states.
And the other one you're going to make contact with is the one you're deeply disagreeing with.
If we confront them, there's a risk of legalizing them.
If you talk properly, you make it clear that talking is not okay.
The point here is that the last decade has probably been a wasted decade for progress on this point.
And while we're trying to figure out this extensive movement across the Arab world, we're not powerless.
By nightfall, the area becomes a black ink, with the exception of a small light bulb or a fire.
Each apartment is unique, and this individuality tells the story of the circumstances and values of each family.
Allow me to show you a dictionary that tells you the character of conflicts here from 1 1 1 1 , 000 to 1 1 1 1 , 000; to this day.
You see in green is a traditional interstate conflict, those we used to read in the press.
I believe that the interference was necessary and that the military interference in Afghanistan was also necessary.
But they're tracking it down.
But there's one thing I don't believe a lot of people think about, that's the background in which a technology intervenes.
Or skiing. It's just fun, and people love to move around doing fun things.
'Cause technically I have engines, I have wheels-- I'm in a motor vehicle.
I took this all the way up tomax Zero, and I made my way through the crowd for an hour.
And I'm not driving any more cars.
And, in fact, this is a thing that a democracy must also do.
(laughs) But actually, it's not my fault; it's out of the paper.
In my new company, Marilyn MonRAI, I would like to use the art to create technology.
We made the robot-- in his head is a database with lots of jokes.
What can I do?
The guy's voice is being heard again.
We're tracking it at the top of the food network, among the seaêtres and the fish.
And we could just see a death net as we descended into the water column.
And then there's the threatening, spinous problem of human health, the effects on human health that have been reported.
And we realize in the West that we know very little about what's going on.
At this hour, talks are going well, do we have to talk to the Muslim Brotherhood?
We're making a difference between talking on a diplomatic level and talking on a political level.
The diplomatic toolbox is actually full of different tools that we can use to strengthen our communication.
We need to improve the necessary skills, and we need to have the courage to use them.
So in short, I'm shocked by all the things they don't have.
If they can do that, why can't the governments and the governments do the same thing?
Someone once described it as bowling in the dark.
They said, "You throw the ball, you hear some pins fall."
And in Africa, in the isolated places, it's hard to find good roads.
And then, inpê, the ethion government launched this new system in its own country.
But then you take the toilet and you present it as a practical, modern, fashionable thing.
And that would only be the second disease to be blown off the face of the earth.
500 years ago, sailing on sailboats began to be dependable enough; we found a new continent.
I don't keep any in my living room.
Depending on who you trust with your numbers, that's between 60 and 85,000 people a day.
We want to help the cutting-edge fields, and we want to do it another way.
In the 20th century, we saw the independent development of two great themes in science.
And she made a very low passage, a few hundred miles above the surface.
And there, it's an image of atoms in the sun's atmosphere absorbing light.
What happens when we hold a star that's right on the edge of that mass?
And there was no carbon or oxygen in the universe during the first generation of stars.
And the core of these key actors are groups that represent different interests within the country.
And he said that, uh, we can win militaryly, Mr. Minister.
But now, as we prepare to talk, we realize how little we know.
And you don't have to agree when you sit with the other side.
Our modern westly society is more complex than in the past, in this time of year.
With this subtraction intelligence, these underground buildings are built on the inside of the ground.
But I think, as a community, we still have a lot to learn.
It matches the product to the kind of life people want to have.
So even though it's an international company, they take a very local approach.
But they didn't stop there.
It doesn't sound like a flag in the wind to me.
A state in northern India has been up to its neck and neck to associate toilets with courtship.
And I'm happy to tell you that only one other person in this area had polio.
Then we'll be running out of polio money here next summer.
Then you don't need anything to control your car, except to think about it.
When Henry Ford started, just a hundred years ago, the T model.
These are completely different, and they're beyond the reach of modern diplomatic.
And we, so, we have a problem, because, uh, they escape the traditional diplomatic system.
And my country trusts its safety through the military alliance, that's clear.
However, we still have an important stake in the treatment and understanding of modern conflicts.
And so, armed forces are required, but the army is not the solution to the problem.
But if you don't talk, you can't get in touch with anyone else.
And I think the international community would have said, "Whoa, whoa, whoa."
Another place that I'd like to share with you is where the Zabbalins are, in the city.
As a matter of fact, when I travel the world in development, Coke seems to be a bit of a mess.
And I believe that there really are three things we can learn from coke.
There's now almost 1,500 of these centers in Africa that employ about 1,500 people.
I think an excellent example of this is the new ethion's drunken health plan.
The two songs have something in common, the same call to celebration and unity.
And there are some signs around the world that things are starting to change.
As you've noticed, every time you come here, you learn something.
What if we could make them fun, attractive, clean, respectful of the environment?
And I can't believe a cop's gonna give himself a ticket.
The Greeks were going from the theater at the Parthenon.
The first cause of human mortality on this planet is the poor quality of water.
We have about $120 million, and we want to make things right.
It took me about 25 seconds to decide that this was a good idea.
It's probably this place, a moon of lola, Europe.
But that bright star there is actually one of the stars in the galaxy.
And the way they treat their conflicts spread quickly to other countries.
After September 1 1 , 1 1 , 1 1 , 1 , you were either with us or against us.
10 years after this military intervention, this country is far from secure.
She's been very, uh-- she's been very forthcoming to say three, four, or five years earlier.
What I mean is you don't need to be neutral to talk.
We're going to make the path of violent activity into politics a harder path of access.
And I wouldn't say that that's the wrong thing under any circumstances.
The electricity is rigged and the purest drinking water comes from fortune wells all over the region.
But I'm surprised by one thing they have: Coke.
That's why I took some time to study coke.
So they take the data, and they use it to measure progress.
In development, the appraisal takes place at the end of the project.
They're 90 percent of all coke sales.
They've trained three hundred and thirty-six thousand rolling care employees to bring care directly to the people.
And in South Africa, they mix happiness with inaudible or respect for the community.
And polio, I think, is one of the strongest examples.
But let me make this story a little more real for you.
They've been to where ansram lives and they've vaccinated two million people.
It's not bad, but why don't we take out the wires?
So the car was a clean, green alternative to horse and wagon.
It was totally rational, with one percent of the people living there.
And we kind of hope that history will say that we were right.
In a Newtonian universe there is no center - thank you.
We can only tell where something is compared to everything else.
But he's not the best candidate to shelter life in the solar system.
We call it the Sun.
There's, I think, another wonderful twist in this story.
It was taken by this thing, which is called the Starship Voyager.
And that's an image of me in front of him to see the ladder.
So he knows what the joke's about, he knows how long it is.
There's trade, there's disarmment, there's cross-frontal relations.
We need military presence, but we need to move on to politics.
Arab spring becomes autumn and winter approaches.
There's a wide range in how to deal with this matter.
And the reason is what happened in South Africa:
And there was a difference between diplomatic and overwhelming power,
They take real-time data and immediately put it in the product.
They're using local business talent, and they're doing an amazing hand-me-down.
So they took some time to figure that out.
And it became number one in 17 countries.
Wash your hands, you may not get diarrhea.
We know that circumcision reduces H.I.V. infections by 60 percent in men.
We've seen a 90 percent reduction in polio in the last 20 years.
(Laughs) Yesterday, the guys at the car show us their new ideas.
In 5,000 years, we've regressed for city travel.
We think a lot about what really makes science work.
Independence from the presence of others, from history and so on.
It started with the invention of the theory of duty and the theory of Asians.
There must be some kind of self-chemistry, inside the universe, that creates things.
All actors with a democracy are part of a relationship network.
And that's really a nice demonstration of how much science costs.
It's, like, a million and a half billion pounds a year out of six and a half billion.
In fact, it's an image of the hydrogen gland.
It's an image of the Earth captured in this sequence of ink.
They say it's an experience that makes humble and forms character.
We know enough at the dawn of the 19th century.
You look great.
I've been trying to reach you since yesterday.
Have you ever seen that little Switzerland knife they're supposed to fight with?
My boyfriend died.
But here's the thing, I'm one of the top people.
So I was then invited to go to the Gulf in May.
So, what do we have?
By the way, we know this because of the black tide of Exxon.
So, in fact, it speeds up the penetration of oil into the body easily and easily.
And then part of that knowledge is part of my nightmares.
And, whether you believe it or not, it's this, a taxi cab toché.
In my opinion, it's significant.
You can say that this is a health issue.
But we had problems with this one.
And the states have a certain reluctance to deal with these conflicts.
And who knows what name he'll have at the end.
I've been assigned to talk to all these groups.
Now conversation can be accompanyed by help or without help.
We in the world need to understand the social capital of the community.
In the lobby, they painted the walls and planted trees.
Without elevators, the tower is a flight of 45 stories of stairs.
The tour of the Zabbalin homes is also full of surprises.
And I'm not the first person to ask that question.
Well, what's the second thing Coke's good at?
Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh.
Now, think about how that can change people's lives.
Now this is well-arranged with the World Cup campaign.
Use a condom, don't get infected with nitro.
And can you guess what these young people are waiting for?
Fifty-five percent of the surface of our cities matches the parked cars.
For only Asia, it will be over one billion people.
They didn't have to walk the same hundred-year path as we did.
And I would like to talk to you about three stages in this evolution.
So, in a relationship universe, we need to have self-arranged processes.
We're going through a difficult and demanding time on an economic level, of course.
There you see, it's about 620 billion a year.
I just wanted to show this image because it's remarkable.
It's actually an image of the sun's ghost.
But look at the number of black lines in this ghost.
It's just one of the billion galaxies in the universe.
So, I think that science can be-- that shelter is important.
It can be beautiful and reveal some pretty amazing things.
It's kind of like a stone because, of course, it's a stone.
And if I go up to there, you see it.
It's here. It's the house. It's us.
We don't need to find out more about our universe.
And he's gonna try to observe your reaction.
If you appreciate what's happening, show the green side.
Another pulls out his cell phone and calls 911.
Well, the big chemical companies are what we're dealing with here.
And that was the entire sea ducks food network.
The question I'm asking is, why shouldn't we know?
And in order to do that, we need to do this appraisal.
Some of us surviving in the war, some of us surviving in the war, some of us surviving in the war.
What the hell's a neRAIscope?
There are still people who believe it and they came.
At an O.V.D. of 4,500 percent, when normal is 8,500 percent.
And I can tell you, our schedule is full.
So a certain way, that's everybody's business.
The situation, to be honest, is very serious.
Because we never talked to people in these countries.
Now my friends in South Africa know that it was very painful.
The solution is a strategy of commitment and remerciement based on principles.
They're good at using these local business skills.
It feels good, doesn't it?
Well, it's based on avoidance, not perception.
I'm sure you've heard some of these messages.
But there's a solution: you build toilets.
I even saw it used as a chicken coop.
The disease could have come from two places.
Fifty percent of the world's population now lives in the city.
We all love our cars, and I love them too.
In fact, what are we up against right now?
They start at the top of the food chain of technology.
We don't need complicated heart transplants around the world.
I don't know, but we'll try.
This universe is described as a network of relationships.
All the property of things depends on these types of relationships.
So here's general humility, here's such a thing as back-up theory.
So, an interesting discussion is taking place.
This latest vision of sophistication is called relationship vision.
We think it could be hundreds of miles deep.
Well, this looks like an image of, like, nothing at all.
It's a limit to the mass of the stars.
So this star is also 50 million light years away.
So, this doesn't look like our planet.
But he's visited lola, lola, Uranus, and lola.
And we're moving forward today in this difficult economic period.
(Laughs) We're based in New York City.
Each one of these jokes has a specific hunch.
Well, then, let's make way for robot stand-up.
- How can there be any worse news?
So thank you all for being a part of it.
And we hope to learn a lot about robot communication.
So this is a case of suspicion of innocence.
And we dived into the table cloth without any dangerous material.
All right, well, all right.
So it's a very sensitive species to this combination.
And we're hoping some of you guys will help us.
Whatever it is, please let us get the truth.
I graduated from high school at Cleveland High School in Ohio in dét.
I graduated from college, graduated from medical school.
Tell me, how many passengers do you think there are on that cab?
Believe it or not, some of us survive.
We're going on a mission.
health is wealth, as Hans Rosler says.
Well, here we are, on a mission.
Yeah, let's fix this thing.
It doesn't matter, because it worked fine.
Our brains are three times the size of a gorilla;
There, it started to bother me seriously.
And we struggle with how to deal with them.
Red is a modern conflict, conflicts within the states.
We can only solve this problem with a political solution.
It'll last a long, long time.
Because they can turn out to be a majority.
Moving can be accompanied with or without mooring.
So, what can we learn from all this?
Maybe it's a first piece of change.
The good news is we're not powerless.
There are very few systems in the world.
It's amazing, if you think about Coke.
Let's compare it to development for a minute.
Well, they're already starting to talk about this.
The third part of Coke's success isigned.
People serve it for material.
Then why is all this so important?
We got down to a one-sixty-six-year-old.
You don't need snow.
They got bigger, they spread.
This was the triumph of new-darwinism, and so on.
The most important was performed by Chase Econo run.
And electrons can only be found in certain particular places.
Actually, this one's a carbon/oxygen midget.
This is a spectacular image of our home planet.
It's our planet viewed from a billion miles away.
He said, consider that point again.
I think he's going to be very popular.
He's talking about the Switzerland.
Do you like television?
The burden of evidence does not rest on the producer.
Had a violent pain in my throat two days later.
Then there's the problem of the peach trees.
In outer casing, there was one of those carbobutoxyethanol, which is causing internal bleeding.
And, guess what, there's a ton of stuff missing.
With oil alone, there's one hundred and forty percent fertilization.
I myself, I was able to see it easily in the water column.
What, in our opinion, would be a tropical stunt?
Look at this bag here.
You get richer faster if you're healthy first.
There's Mike, and he's from s.H.I.R.
You pick out what instruments you need, you stock up on drinks,
These are my classmates from class of ' marches.
The human brain isn't a big rat brain.
Why does he consume so much energy, then?
It distracts him with nice images, irrelevant data.
I'm gonna talk to you about two things.
What's the social result of that?
It will concern people from all over America.
Alan Kay will talk to you later today.
What's the cost of this communications system?
Here's the line:
But my most important question is always the same.
We sit around and she forges our minds.
Black holes are dark on a black sky bottom.
C.J. is the great general theory on the humility of Mr. Einstein.
Even the light would be diverted along these paths.
He thought nature would protect us from their training.
But basically that's what we're talking about.
They can turn hundreds of times a second.
And we can predict the sound it will make.
(Laughs) You should get away from the sound.
In this Hubble image we see two galaxies.
They almost appear to be embraced in a hug.
This is not arming our country to the teeth.
And I said, "Yes, Your Holiness."
But I don't believe in effortless hope.
And a few months later I was writing songs.
You become your country, you become your religion.
There are fishermen and saints, criminals and victims.
And groups are very often labeled immediately as the terrorists of the world.
You can't talk to everyone all the time.
We didn't realize what was happening.
But we can talk in different ways.
We must embrace these profound changes.
But this strategy never gets us very far.
They sell, like, a million and a half billion drinks a day.
So what's the next step on the way to lying around?
And it's working.
Women refuse to marry men who don't have toilets.
Let's look at a country like India.
They have two and a half million people who can vaccinate.
And a lot more people could have been infected.
It's not the field handouts.
But think of where the world is today, eight.
All other forms of transportation have been improved.
I don't look like a motor vehicle.
And the camera's fixing it.
We have to show them this thing.
( mechanical noises ) ( music ) ( applause )
And here are some ethics principles.
I'm in mode and I'm impressed.
The idea was that everything is determined.
As a matter of fact, dirt and Locke were friends.
They're thinking about the same things.
So that's what we're gonna talk about.
So that's what we're gonna talk about.
And that's why he calls helicopter.
Well, this is an image of it.
This was taken by the Cassini probe.
It's Earth six billion miles away.
He was clearly being assaulted the whole time.
It's named after the character from Starmax.
Because she's his match.
You've been a great audience.
And it shows.
So, my project lies along the Atlantic Northwest.
They end up in sewage processing plants.
And we let the industry lead the dance.
I felt my throat was on fire.
And usually, exhibition is a combined exhibition.
The solvents they contain make it very effective.
It'll also cause internal bleeding during the inhalation.
We've begun to argue, what do we know?
We've joined some partners.
Don't we have a right to know?
So I'm happy to be here.
You can say that this is partly an education issue.
Trust me, these are current photos.
Today, everyone uses the P.A.X. anyway.
Our oxygen tanks weren't working very well.
That's what I mean when I talk about proper technology.
That's exactly how the sockets are designed.
This oxygen delivery technology is not new.
Why is the human brain so special?
I don't think we look like this.
First, you capture atoms in a special bottle,
Dancing actually makes science easier to understand.
But you don't have to take my word for it.
And that brings me to my modest proposal.
We certainly can't argue with these numbers!
Are people satisfied with the results?
The cost of cars is underrated, so it's over-consumed.
We need to set up a better return from the market,
We're going to be able to make this retroactive cycle possible in real time.
♪ ♪
(Laughs) We also call them e-mail networks.
I'll give you some examples.
I'll close with two points:
And even the light couldn't escape that current.
This is the hard work of a scientist in hard conditions.
He didn't believe they existed in nature.
Can you imagine being at the big bang's hometown?
We're in a hurry, build your instruments!
And this little girl is coming at me.
You become a Christian, a Muslim, a Jew.
And there are times when you should go.
The social groups have gone down the streets.
Then let's start with the data.
They have this constant circle of returns.
Let's look at the development now.
So how does health care and development do their business.
And I think that's a mistake.
Well, you work with the community.
But more importantly, it saves lives.
For me this is a deep happiness.
No one would want to do without that.
For the 20 biggest cities in the world.
They started directly with cell phones.
And this network of relationships is constantly evolving.
So we call it a relationship universe.
It's about a half a mile long; about 500 miles.
It's a picture of more of an enemy.
That's when Cassini flew under the En back.
And they saw strange images like this.
It's an explosion of a supersuction of 1 1a.
And he took this image of Earth.
He knows how intense it is.
He doesn't have feelings... yet.
It's an honor to be here.
Here's the first.
One of them falls on the floor.
He doesn't seem to be breathing.
I find it incredibly teaching.
(Laughs) That's all for today.
Was that right for my premiere?
There are many other things to come.
It's, on a scale of one area, an Ecotoxicology study.
We hardly control them.
The decision was to protect the swamp.
So, here we see oil on the surface.
So here we have another scenario.
Is it better with one eye or both?
So that's not rational at all.
So, that's how it works.
They're unidentified.
But that's how my nightmares present themselves.
So, we're launching an independent study.
And that's my specialty.
Open-heart surgery in faire, it's a big problem.
Does he seem happy to you?
We get a lot of equipment.
So, what are we gonna do now?
We've successfully operated on 12 open heart patients.
Have you ever seen anything like this?
That's what makes him so special.
Well, what about our brains?
It's just a big primate brain.
What happened, then?
I have a doctorate in molecular biology.
And strangely enough, it seems to be working.
They do it by altering their shape.
In Portsmouth, the U.K.,
How do we build a big network?
We see the light reflected by the moon,
They're making a fuss all around.
These are the natural curves of space.

And they brought their knowledge.
Thank you for your attention.
Then why is this interesting?

Can you believe it?
How did this get here?
So what's the result?
And we're so close.
(Laughs) That's reassuring.
It was twice as long.
