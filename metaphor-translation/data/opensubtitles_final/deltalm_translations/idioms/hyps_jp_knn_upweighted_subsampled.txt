More or less.
You're outnumbered.
You're outnumbered.
You're outnumbered.

I feel like I'm waking up from a nightmare. I can't believe it.
What if that dream doesn't wake up?
I'm awake.

You will never find that dream place.

I had a crazy second dream.
I had a really weird dream while I blacked out.
A couple of months before she died, she had a dream about me, and when I woke up, I came here.

Every night, my late wife's standing on a pillow.
That droids are a problem.

Rest assured, Detective, if you let me take care of Eddie's killer, it won't be too much trouble.
Enough to get rid of it.

And maybe innocent people will never come back.
I forgot to look over it.
Looks like we're in the clear.
As soon as the curtain rises, I'll kill the goddess.
You're putting us in a tough spot.
Now the door's open. The past is just the beginning.
And it didn't matter. There was another act going on.

I believe there must be some little money, good or bad.
Well, that's a good start.
A good start.

This ship is thicker than this one, right?
Within a month or two, capital will be tighter.
I wouldn't have done that if I'd been closing the shop.
But that's why you opened the shop.
You don't see me closing the shop?
- When you close the shop, you die.
Then shut it down and get out.
I pulled a bow knowing it was dangerous.
I wasn't referring to the wheelゴールe.
You're sick of it. He brought Laurel in.
Apparently, in one of your books, that Ennis told you about someone being abused, he framed the neighbor anonymously.
He's a millionaire like Oliver Queen, and he's a millionaire.
It might trigger the trailer, remind you of everything.
He was injured in the head three years ago, which may have triggered an early seizure.
It's his trigger word.
Worst-case scenario, I don't dwell on anyone.

She's throwing up a weeping.
This is the first public statement you've made.
No, you've got the money.
That's a nice touch.

He was a coward, thin shadow.
No shadow, no shape.
You can hide it without a shadow or shape.

Tell me, Harold, how can a man be so bad at work?
It's a bad place to be.
Either way, I'm running out of time.

I apologize for being so blunt, but...
It was empty. That's what we're gonna do.
If we post it on the Internet, it'll be the night of the week.

I can't take the fall for this.
Since Tommy left, we've been taking a turn.
Don't look back, Harry Potter!

I'm even happy to sit on your replacement.
You kicked me out of my position, and activated yourself to sit on the tail.

But, I don't think so.
They kill everything... with no mercy or remorse.
I'm losing my mind.
Your heart yearned for my offer.

What do you have in mind?
I'm speculating that we'll never catch them.

Since your husband's wrath got busted, he's had a hard time with the translator.
And so, the two bad witches who tried to take the princess, they were angry with the king.

Whatever you do, I'm out of breath.
Sounds like you're out of breath.
I can't breathe. Please don't make me fly.
You two seem to be getting along famously.
Come on. We're a team. We're breathing together.
Your men are breathing, Maroni.
His helmet was suffocating.
I'm locking you up till you are suffocating.

Don't be a whisperer.
Why don't you just man up and admit it?
Through our hearts.
You don't have guts, do you?
I think we're in this together.
My daughter is coming over for lunch, and I thought maybe you and I could work something out.
We were kindred spirits.
I thought you were being paranoid.
It was obscene.
You need to learn to be unexpected.
Hit the whip of love, baby.
That team is lost in thought.
I got nothing left of Earth.
My mom spoiled me.
You left me out of it out of courtesy, didn't you?
It's normal to fall in love with such a husband.
You're an asshole.
Why do you act like a son of a bitch all the time?
The end of civilization.
It's going to be the end of the world.
It's the end of the Columbus Circle.
Yeah, he's angry, he forgets himself, he grabs the stuff around him, and he beats him.
A Grimm who's forgotten himself can be killed.
The only way society survives and thrives is for each of us to find the right place to be.
You don't have to fight to get another place.

Do you need food to have a family?
- It's time to have a family.
We don't have a choice. Change of plans.
We don't have a choice.
We don't have a choice.
Can you believe he's got an assistant?
There's a buyer coming to your house, a young couple.
But by the time he killed 36 people, my addiction was lost.
There's more to him than you can imagine.
The cops picked him up.
I.A.'s going after him. We had to let him go.
It's still in the process of editing.
Couldn't get a hold of his apartment in Brooklyn.
It's ridiculous separating by the unit of time, whether you're on drugs or not.
Otherwise, your throat will be turned.
It's time to go to work, John.
I'm guessing you've been so busy right now.
I didn't know what to do.
I didn't know what to do with the election.
He didn't have done much on the horizon, but he could have done security.
Looks like he's blocking his hand.
Detective Fusco, please. I can't reach you.
And I couldn't reach him until he cut me off.
- I can't reach him.
That money was a clue to a robbery, kidnapping, drugs.
It's time to move on. Hi, mate.
You're faster than spinning your head.
You should be careful, 'cause they're faster than you think.
That's fast.

You're worse than I thought.
It's complicated.
It's a bit complicated, isn't it?
There's a lot of work to be done.
He approached me and said, "Let's get to work a little while longer..."
Is there anything I can do for you?
- I'm kind of in the middle of something!
I can't do this right now.
So who are you dealing with?
Once you've got them, they'll...
But she didn't listen to me.
I don't have a choice. It's just rock.
She's trying to get to victory without getting her hands dirty.
They don't choose the means to get what they want.
The family doesn't choose anything until they have all the keys, so it's you.
My father used to say that mankind would be more efficient if he had a hammer and a driver instead of a finger.
Some people have beasts sleeping, and when they have a sword, they wake up.
I'm going to be his assistant, so I can help him with his masterpiece before he becomes famous.
A first kiss.
You want to see the blood? I'll be there.
Get in your hand!
I don't care what you do to me.
You're so powerful, and I'm solving most problems at a phenomenal rate, so we're running out of problems.
Yeah, well, there's some things I can't handle.
I don't mean to pressure you, but with $500 more, you'll have a powerful gun.

Not long after you left, of course, the tech was now in the hands of criminals and it fell into their hands.
I can't do this on my own.
Travis, you can't handle him.
I thought it was out of my hands. I thought it was selfish.
If you had any sense, you'd be aware that you're in over your head.
- You want me to show you?
