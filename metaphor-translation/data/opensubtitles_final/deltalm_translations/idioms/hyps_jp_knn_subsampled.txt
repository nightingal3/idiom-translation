I'm sorry, is that bad?
That was a hell of a mess, considering I've only been here five minutes.
It's very embarrassing.
I want to hurt you for what you started.
Hey, if you don't want to finish this, why don't you just stop?

I had an affair with the wrong guy.
- Impossible man.
But there's no such thing as a bookie.
She doesn't have a smile on her face.

If I could get a bit of a partner during my adventure, it wouldn't have come from feelings or whims, but rather a lot of fine qualities.
Well, what if I could help you in exchange for one last little story about your Klaus problem?
Not much.
See, here's the thing, John, that we give our hearts and minds, it's not just one man, it's an ideal.
Which means they're gonna kill me.
What does that mean?
That's it. That's how it works.
And you're hiding here because you know it.
I know you like to pretend you're satisfied with your saying something, but you have something to say to me.
You're acting like nothing is going on.
Perhaps the thief was looking the other way.
I can't wait to see what happens now.
It's embarrassing.
Didn't want to see it.
You don't want to sneak up on me like that.

I'm just placing a spot on a monster hiding under your bed.
But if you're gonna come in here and touch the spotlight...
I want to get a spotlight, but I'm gonna need a partner.
Especially someone who likes the public spotlight.
You don't have a choice throwing towels. We've got two options.

I had a really weird dream while I was unconscious.
About two months before she died, she had a dream about me where I woke up and came here.
The queen dreams that a girl sits in a window when she wakes up and I'm there.
What kind of dream are you drawing?
We assembled our forces under pressure, with more success than we had imagined.
When I had to draw a dream, I threw it away in the world.

A good start.
Well, that's a good start.

I got nothing left of that team.
The earth's managed to get tired of you.
My mom got sick of me.
You left without mercy, right?

He's probably busy. He probably wasn't there.
I'm sure they haven't got around to it yet.
I didn't get around to the election.
- Could have done, but the security is a nightmare.
Looks like you're pinned down.
Zipper, please. I can't reach you.
And you didn't get access to it until you cut me loose.

Guy's got a temper.
It's complicated, isn't it?
You're doing a hell of a job.

Well, a first kiss.
You want to see the blood? I'll be waiting for you.
Give me a hand here!
I'm kind of at a disadvantage here.
You solve puzzles with that intensity and I'm surprisingly fast, so they could embarrass us.
