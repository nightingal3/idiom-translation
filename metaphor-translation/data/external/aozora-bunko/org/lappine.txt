A Haunted House, and other short stories



LAPPIN AND LAPINOVA
They were married. The wedding march pealed out. The pigeons fluttered. Small 
boys in Eton jackets threw rice; a fox terrier sauntered across the path; and 
Ernest Thorburn led his bride to the car through that small inquisitive crowd of 
complete strangers which always collects in London to enjoy other peopleÅfs 
happiness or unhappiness. Certainly he looked handsome and she looked shy. More 
rice was thrown, and the car moved off.
That was on Tuesday. Now it was Saturday. Rosalind had still to get used to the 
fact that she was Mrs. Ernest Thorburn. Perhaps she never would get used to the 
fact that she was Mrs. Ernest Anybody, she thought, as she sat in the bow window 
of the hotel looking over the lake to the mountains, and waited for her husband 
to come down to breakfast. Ernest was a difficult name to get used to. It was 
not the name she would have chosen. She would have preferred Timothy, Antony, or 
Peter. He did not look like Ernest either. The name suggested the Albert 
Memorial, mahogany sideboards, steel engravings of the Prince Consort with his 
family&#8212;her mother&#8211;in&#8211;lawÅfs dining&#8211;room in Porchester Terrace in short.
But here he was. Thank goodness he did not look like Ernest&#8212;no. But what did he 
look like? She glanced at him sideways. Well, when he was eating toast he looked 
like a rabbit. Not that anyone else would have seen a likeness to a creature so 
diminutive and timid in this spruce, muscular young man with the straight nose, 
the blue eyes, and the very firm mouth. But that made it all the more amusing. 
His nose twitched very slightly when he ate. So did her pet rabbitÅfs. She kept 
watching his nose twitch; and then she had to explain, when he caught her 
looking at him, why she laughed.
ÅgItÅfs because youÅfre like a rabbit, Ernest,Åh she said. ÅgLike a wild rabbit,Åh she 
added, looking at him. ÅgA hunting rabbit; a King Rabbit; a rabbit that makes 
laws for all the other rabbits.Åh
Ernest had no objection to being that kind of rabbit, and since it amused her to 
see him twitch his nose&#8212;he had never known that his nose twitched&#8212;he twitched it 
on purpose. And she laughed and laughed; and he laughed too, so that the maiden 
ladies and the fishing man and the Swiss waiter in his greasy black jacket all 
guessed right; they were very happy. But how long does such happiness last? they 
asked themselves; and each answered according to his own circumstances.
At lunch time, seated on a clump of heather beside the lake, ÅgLettuce, rabbit?Åh 
said Rosalind, holding out the lettuce that had been provided to eat with the 
hardboiled eggs. ÅgCome and take it out of my hand,Åh she added, and he stretched 
out and nibbled the lettuce and twitched his nose.
ÅgGood rabbit, nice rabbit,Åh she said, patting him, as she used to pat her tame 
rabbit at home. But that was absurd. He was not a tame rabbit, whatever he was. 
She turned it into French. ÅgLapin,Åh she called him. But whatever he was, he was 
not a French rabbit. He was simply and solely English&#8211;born at Porchester 
Terrace, educated at Rugby; now a clerk in His MajestyÅfs Civil Service. So she 
tried ÅgBunnyÅh next; but that was worse. ÅgBunnyÅh was someone plump and soft and 
comic; he was thin and hard and serious. Still, his nose twitched. ÅgLappin,Åh she 
exclaimed suddenly; and gave a little cry as if she had found the very word she 
looked for.
ÅgLappin, Lappin, King Lappin,Åh she repeated. It seemed to suit him exactly; he 
was not Ernest, he was King Lappin. Why? She did not know.
When there was nothing new to talk about on their long solitary walks&#8212;and it 
rained, as everyone had warned them that it would rain; or when they were 
sitting over the fire in the evening, for it was cold, and the maiden ladies had 
gone and the fishing man, and the waiter only came if you rang the bell for him, 
she let her fancy play with the story of the Lappin tribe. Under her hands&#8212;she 
was sewing; he was readingthey became very real, very vivid, very amusing. 
Ernest put down the paper and helped her. There were the black rabbits and the 
red; there were the enemy rabbits and the friendly. There were the wood in which 
they lived and the outlying prairies and the swamp. Above all there was King 
Lappin, who, far from having only the one trick&#8212;that he twitched his nose&#8212;became 
as the days passed an animal of the greatest character; Rosalind was always 
finding new qualities in him. But above all he was a great hunter.
ÅgAnd what,Åh said Rosalind, on the last day of the honeymoon, Ågdid the King do 
to&#8211;day?Åh
In fact they had been climbing all day; and she had worn a blister on her heel; 
but she did not mean that.
ÅgTo&#8211;day,Åh said Ernest, twitching his nose as he bit the end off his cigar, Åghe 
chased a hare.Åh He paused; struck a match, and twitched again.
ÅgA woman hare,Åh he added.
ÅgA white hare!Åh Rosalind exclaimed, as if she had been expecting this. ÅgRather a 
small hare; silver grey; with big bright eyes?Åh
ÅgYes,Åh said Ernest, looking at her as she had looked at him, Åga smallish animal; 
with eyes popping out of her head, and two little front paws dangling.Åh It was 
exactly how she sat, with her sewing dangling in her hands; and her eyes, that 
were so big and bright, were certainly a little prominent.
ÅgAh, Lapinova,Åh Rosalind murmured.
ÅgIs that what sheÅfs called?Åh said Ernest&#8212;Ågthe real Rosalind?Åh He looked at her. 
He felt very much in love with her.
ÅgYes; thatÅfs what sheÅfs called,Åh said Rosalind. ÅgLapinova.Åh And before they went 
to bed that night it was all settled. He was King Lappin; she was Queen 
Lapinova. They were the opposite of each other; he was bold and determined; she 
wary and undependable. He ruled over the busy world of rabbits; her world was a 
desolate, mysterious place, which she ranged mostly by moonlight. All the same, 
their territories touched; they were King and Queen.
Thus when they came back from their honeymoon they possessed a private world, 
inhabited, save for the one white hare, entirely by rabbits. No one guessed that 
there was such a place, and that of course made it all the more amusing. It made 
them feel, more even than most young married couples, in league together against 
the rest of the world. Often they looked slyly at each other when people talked 
about rabbits and woods and traps and shooting. Or they winked furtively across 
the table when Aunt Mary said that she could never bear to see a hare in a 
dish&#8212;it looked so like a baby: or when John, ErnestÅfs sporting brother, told 
them what price rabbits were fetching that autumn in Wiltshire, skins and all. 
Sometimes when they wanted a gamekeeper, or a poacher or a Lord of the Manor, 
they amused themselves by distributing the parts among their friends. ErnestÅfs 
mother, Mrs. Reginald Thorburn, for example, fitted the part of the Squire to 
perfection. But it was all secret&#8212;that was the point of it; nobody save 
themselves knew that such a world existed.
Without that world, how, Rosalind wondered, that winter could she have lived at 
all? For instance, there was the golden&#8211;wedding party, when all the Thorburns 
assembled at Porchester Terrace to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of that 
union which had been so blessed&#8212;had it not produced Ernest Thorburn? and so 
fruitful&#8212;had it not produced nine other sons and daughters into the bargain, 
many themselves married and also fruitful? She dreaded that party. But it was 
inevitable. As she walked upstairs she felt bitterly that she was an only child 
and an orphan at that; a mere drop among all those Thorburns assembled in the 
great drawing&#8211;room with the shiny satin wallpaper and the lustrous family 
portraits. The living Thorburns much resembled the painted; save that instead of 
painted lips they had real lips; out of which came jokes; jokes about 
schoolrooms, and how they had pulled the chair from under the governess; jokes 
about frogs and how they had put them between the virgin sheets of maiden 
ladies. As for herself, she had never even made an apple&#8211;pie bed. Holding her 
present in her hand she advanced toward her mother&#8211;in&#8211;law sumptuous in yellow 
satin; and toward her father&#8211;in&#8211;law decorated with a rich yellow carnation. All 
round them on tables and chairs there were golden tributes, some nestling in 
cotton wool; others branching resplendent&#8212;candlesticks; cigar boxes; chains; 
each stamped with the goldsmithÅfs proof that it was solid gold, hall&#8211;marked, 
authentic. But her present was only a little pinchbeck box pierced with holes; 
an old sand caster, an eighteenth&#8211;century relic, once used to sprinkle sand over 
wet ink. Rather a senseless present she felt&#8212;in an age of blotting paper; and as 
she proffered it, she saw in front of her the stubby black handwriting in which 
her mother&#8211;in&#8211;law when they were engaged had expressed the hope that ÅgMy son 
will make you happy.Åh No, she was not happy. Not at all happy. She looked at 
Ernest, straight as a ramrod with a nose like all the noses in the family 
portraits; a nose that never twitched at all.
Then they went down to dinner. She was half hidden by the great chrysanthemums 
that curled their red and gold petals into large tight balls. Everything was 
gold. A gold&#8211;edged card with gold initials intertwined recited the list of all 
the dishes that would be set one after another before them. She dipped her spoon 
in a plate of clear golden fluid. The raw white fog outside had been turned by 
the lamps into a golden mesh that blurred the edges of the plates and gave the 
pineapples a rough golden skin. Only she herself in her white wedding dress 
peering ahead of her with her prominent eyes seemed insoluble as an icicle.
As the dinner wore on, however, the room grew steamy with heat. Beads of 
perspiration stood out on the menÅfs foreheads. She felt that her icicle was 
being turned to water. She was being melted; dispersed; dissolved into 
nothingness; and would soon faint. Then through the surge in her head and the 
din in her ears she heard a womanÅfs voice exclaim, ÅgBut they breed so!Åh
The Thorburns&#8211;yes; they breed so, she echoed; looking at all the round red faces 
that seemed doubled in the giddiness that overcame her; and magnified in the 
gold mist that enhaloed them. ÅgThey breed so.Åh Then John bawled:
ÅgLittle devils! . . . Shoot Åfem! Jump on Åfem with big boots! ThatÅfs the only way 
to deal with Åfem . . . rabbits!Åh
At that word, that magic word, she revived. Peeping between the chrysanthemums 
she saw ErnestÅfs nose twitch. It rippled, it ran with successive twitches. And 
at that a mysterious catastrophe befell the Thorburns. The golden table became a 
moor with the gorse in full bloom; the din of voices turned to one peal of 
larkÅfs laughter ringing down from the sky. It was a blue sky&#8212;clouds passed 
slowly. And they had all been changed&#8212;the Thorburns. She looked at her 
father&#8211;in&#8211;law, a furtive little man with dyed moustaches. His foible was 
collecting things&#8212;seals, enamel boxes, trifles from eighteenth&#8211;century dressing 
tables which he hid in the drawers of his study from his wife. Now she saw him 
as he was&#8212;a poacher, stealing off with his coat bulging with pheasants and 
partridges to drop them stealthily into a three&#8211;legged pot in his smoky little 
cottage. That was her real father&#8211;in&#8211;law&#8212;a poacher. And Celia, the unmarried 
daughter, who always nosed out other peopleÅfs secrets, the little things they 
wished to hide&#8212;she was a white ferret with pink eyes, and a nose clotted with 
earth from her horrid underground nosings and pokings. Slung round menÅfs 
shoulders, in a net, and thrust down a hole&#8212;it was a pitiable life&#8212;CeliaÅfs; it 
was none of her fault. So she saw Celia. And then she looked at her 
mother&#8211;in&#8211;law&#8212;whom they dubbed The Squire. Flushed, coarse, a bully&#8212;she was all 
that, as she stood returning thanks, but now that Rosalind&#8212;that is Lapinova&#8212;saw 
her, she saw behind her the decayed family mansion, the plaster peeling off the 
walls, and heard her, with a sob in her voice, giving thanks to her children 
(who hated her) for a world that had ceased to exist. There was a sudden 
silence. They all stood with their glasses raised; they all drank; then it was 
over.
ÅgOh, King Lappin!Åh she cried as they went home together in the fog, Ågif your 
nose hadnÅft twitched just at that moment, I should have been trapped!Åh
ÅgBut youÅfre safe,Åh said King Lappin, pressing her paw.
ÅgQuite safe,Åh she answered.
And they drove back through the Park, King and Queen of the marsh, of the mist, 
and of the gorse&#8211;scented moor.
Thus time passed; one year; two years of time. And on a winterÅfs night, which 
happened by a coincidence to be the anniversary of the golden&#8211;wedding party&#8212;but 
Mrs. Reginald Thorburn was dead; the house was to let; and there was only a 
caretaker in residence&#8212;Ernest came home from the office. They had a nice little 
home; half a house above a saddlerÅfs shop in South Kensington, not far from the 
tube station. It was cold, with fog in the air, and Rosalind was sitting over 
the fire, sewing.
ÅgWhat dÅfyou think happened to me to&#8211;day?Åh she began as soon as he had settled 
himself down with his legs stretched to the blaze. ÅgI was crossing the stream 
when&#8212;&#8212;Åh
ÅgWhat stream?Åh Ernest interrupted her.
ÅgThe stream at the bottom, where our wood meets the black wood,Åh she explained.
Ernest looked completely blank for a moment.
ÅgWhat the deuce are you talking about?Åh he asked.
ÅgMy dear Ernest!Åh she cried in dismay. ÅgKing Lappin,Åh she added, dangling her 
little front paws in the firelight. But his nose did not twitch. Her hands&#8212;they 
turned to hands&#8212;clutched the stuff she was holding; her eyes popped half out of 
her head. It took him five minutes at least to change from Ernest Thorburn to 
King Lappin; and while she waited she felt a load on the back of her neck, as if 
somebody were about to wring it. At last he changed to King Lappin; his nose 
twitched; and they spent the evening roaming the woods much as usual.
But she slept badly. In the middle of the night she woke, feeling as if 
something strange had happened to her. She was stiff and cold. At last she 
turned on the light and looked at Ernest lying beside her. He was sound asleep. 
He snored. But even though he snored, his nose remained perfectly still. It 
looked as if it had never twitched at all. Was it possible that he was really 
Ernest; and that she was really married to Ernest? A vision of her 
mother&#8211;in&#8211;lawÅfs dining&#8211;room came before her; and there they sat, she and Ernest, 
grown old, under the engravings, in front of the sideboard. . .. It was their 
golden&#8211;wedding day. She could not bear it.
ÅgLappin, King Lappin!Åh she whispered, and for a moment his nose seemed to twitch 
of its own accord. But he still slept. ÅgWake up, Lappin, wake up!Åh she cried.
Ernest woke; and seeing her sitting bolt upright beside him he asked:
ÅgWhatÅfs the matter?Åh
ÅgI thought my rabbit was dead!Åh she whimpered. Ernest was angry.
ÅgDonÅft talk such rubbish, Rosalind,Åh he said. ÅgLie down and go to sleep.Åh
He turned over. In another moment he was sound asleep and snoring.
But she could not sleep. She lay curled up on her side of the bed, like a hare 
in its form. She had turned out the light, but the street lamp lit the ceiling 
faintly, and the trees outside made a lacy network over it as if there were a 
shadowy grove on the ceiling in which she wandered, turning, twisting, in and 
out, round and round, hunting, being hunted, hearing the bay of hounds and 
horns; flying, escaping . . . until the maid drew the blinds and brought their 
early tea.
Next day she could settle to nothing. She seemed to have lost something. She 
felt as if her body had shrunk; it had grown small, and black and hard. Her 
joints seemed stiff too, and when she looked in the glass, which she did several 
times as she wandered about the flat, her eyes seemed to burst out of her head, 
like currants in a bun. The rooms also seemed to have shrunk. Large pieces of 
furniture jutted out at odd angles and she found herself knocking against them. 
At last she put on her hat and went out. She walked along the Cromwell Road; and 
every room she passed and peered into seemed to be a dining&#8211;room where people 
sat eating under steel engravings, with thick yellow lace curtains, and mahogany 
sideboards. At last she reached the Natural History Museum; she used to like it 
when she was a child. But the first thing she saw when she went in was a stuffed 
hare standing on sham snow with pink glass eyes. Somehow it made her shiver all 
over. Perhaps it would be better when dusk fell. She went home and sat over the 
fire, without a light, and tried to imagine that she was out alone on a moor; 
and there was a stream rushing; and beyond the stream a dark wood. But she could 
get no further than the stream. At last she squatted down on the bank on the wet 
grass, and sat crouched in her chair, with her hands dangling empty, and her 
eyes glazed, like glass eyes, in the firelight. Then there was the crack of a 
gun. . .. She started as if she had been shot. It was only Ernest, turning his 
key in the door. She waited, trembling. He came in and switched on the light. 
There he stood, tall, handsome, rubbing his hands that were red with cold.
ÅgSitting in the dark?Åh he said.
ÅgOh, Ernest, Ernest!Åh she cried, starting up in her chair.
ÅgWell, whatÅfs up now?Åh he asked briskly, warming his hands at the fire.
ÅgItÅfs Lapinova . . .Åh she faltered, glancing wildly at him out of her great 
startled eyes. ÅgSheÅfs gone, Ernest. IÅfve lost her!Åh
Ernest frowned. He pressed his lips tight together. ÅgOh, thatÅfs whatÅfs up, is 
it?Åh he said, smiling rather grimly at his wife. For ten seconds he stood there, 
silent; and she waited, feeling hands tightening at the back of her neck.
ÅgYes,Åh he said at length. ÅgPoor Lapinova. . .Åh He straightened his tie at the 
looking&#8211;glass over the mantelpiece.
ÅgCaught in a trap,Åh he said, Ågkilled,Åh and sat down and read the newspaper.
So that was the end of that marriage.
