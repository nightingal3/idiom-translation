Can technical writers earn money by writing free documentation for free
software? We seriously hope so, and that is the reason for the GNU Free
Documentation License.

The GFDL is meant as a way to enlist commercial publishers in funding free
documentation without surrendering any vital liberty. The "cover text"
feature, and certain other aspects of the license that deal with covers,
title page, history, and endorsements, are included to make the license
appealing to commercial publishers for books whose authors are paid. To
improve the appeal, I consulted specifically with staff of publishing
companies, as well as lawyers, free documentation writers, and the
community at large, in writing the GFDL.

At least two commercial publishers of software manuals have told me they
are interested in using this license. The future is never a sure thing, but
the GFDL looks like it has a good chance to succeed in shaping a social
system where commercial publishers pay people to write commercial free
manuals for free software.
