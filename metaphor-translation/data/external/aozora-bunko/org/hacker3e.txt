The Hacker FAQNEWS!
A version of this has been bought by IBM DeveloperWorks. 
Furthermore, IBM sponsored another article, the Manager FAQ, a guide to managers 
for hackers who are frustrated and confused by corporate life. I'd like to thank 
IBM for their kind support of this project. I'm pretty happy with the new piece, 
and I'm glad to have finally been nudged into posting it. 
I'd like to point out how reasonable and friendly IBM has been about this; 
compare with the way that CRC has treated Eric Weisstein.
The Hacker FAQ
The following list is an attempt to cover some of the issues that will 
invariably come up when people without previous experience of the hacker 
community try to hire a hacker. This FAQ is intended for free distribution, and

Questions and Answers:
Section 0: Basic understanding.
  0.0: Won't my hacker break into my computer and steal my trade secrets? 
  No. Hackers aren't, contrary to media reporting, the people who break into 
  computers. Those are crackers. Hackers are people who enjoy playing with 
  computers. Your hacker may occasionally circumvent security measures, but this 
  is not malicious; she just does it when the security is in her way, or because 
  she's curious. 
  0.1: Was it a good idea to hire a hacker? 
  It depends on the job. A hacker can be dramatically more effective than a 
  non-hacker at a job, or dramatically less effective. Jobs where hackers are 
  particularly good are: 
    Systems administration 
    Programming 
    Design 
  Jobs where hackers are particularly bad are:
    Data entry 
  More generally, a job that requires fast and unexpected changes, significant 
  skill, and is not very repetitive will be one a hacker will excel at. 
  Repetitive, simple jobs are a waste of a good hacker, and will make your 
  hacker bored and frustrated. No one works well bored and frustrated.
  The good news is, if you get a hacker on something he particularly likes, you 
  will frequently see performance on the order of five to ten times what a 
  "normal" worker would produce. This is not consistent, and you shouldn't 
  expect to see it all the time, but it will happen. This is most visible on 
  particularly difficult tasks.
  0.2: How should I manage my hacker? 
  The same way you herd cats. It can be a bit confusing; they're not like most 
  other workers. Don't worry! Your hacker is likely to be willing to suggest 
  answers to problems, if asked. Most hackers are nearly self-managing. 
  0.3: Wait, you just said "10 times", didn't you? You're not serious, right? 
  Actually, I said "ten times". And yes, I am serious; a hacker on a roll may be 
  able to produce, in a period of a few months, something that a small 
  development group (say, 7-8 people) would have a hard time getting together 
  over a year. He also may not. Your mileage will vary. 
  IBM used to report that certain programmers might be as much as 100 times as 
  productive as other workers, or more. This kind of thing happens.
  0.4: I don't understand this at all. This is confusing. Is there a book on 
  this? 
  Not yet. In the meantime, check out The New Hacker's Dictionary (references 
  below; also known as "the jargon file"), in particular some of the appendices. 
  The entire work is full of clarifications and details of how hackers think. 
Section 1: Social issues
  1.0: My hacker doesn't fit in well with our corporate society. She seems to do 
  her work well, but she's not really making many friends. 
  This is common. Your hacker may not have found any people around who get along 
  with hackers. You may wish to consider offering her a position telecommuting, 
  or flexible hours (read: night shift), which may actually improve her 
  productivity. Or hire another one. 
  1.1: My hacker seems to dress funny. Is there any way to impress upon him the 
  importance of corporate appearance? 
  Your hacker has a very good understanding of the importance of corporate 
  appearance. It doesn't help you get your job done. IBM, Ford, and Microsoft 
  have all realized that people work better when they can dress however they 
  want. Your hacker is dressed comfortably. A polite request to dress up some 
  for special occasions may well be honored, and most hackers will cheerfully 
  wear clothes without (unintentional) holes in them if specifically asked. 
  1.2: My hacker won't call me by my title, and doesn't seem to respect me at 
  all. 
  Your hacker doesn't respect your title. Hackers don't believe that management 
  is "above" engineering; they believe that management is doing one job, and 
  engineering is doing another. They may well frequently talk as if management 
  is beneath them, but this is really quite fair; your question implies that you 
  talk as if engineering is beneath you. Treat your hacker as an equal, and she 
  will probably treat you as an equal -- quite a compliment! 
  1.3: My hacker constantly insults the work of my other workers. 
  Take your hacker aside, and ask for details of what's wrong with the existing 
  work. It may be that there's something wrong with it. Don't let the fact that 
  it runs most of the time fool you; your hacker is probably bothered by the 
  fact that it crashes at all. He may be able to suggest improvements which 
  could dramatically improve performance, reliability, or other features. It's 
  worth looking into. 
  You may be able to convince your hacker to be more polite, but if there appear 
  to be major differences, it's quite possible that one or more of your existing 
  staff are incompetent. Note that hackers, of course, have different standards 
  of competence than many other people. (Read "different" as "much higher".)
Section 2: Productivity.
  2.0: My hacker plays video games on company time. 
  Hackers, writers, and painters all need some amount of time to spend 
  "percolating" -- doing something else to let their subconscious work on a 
  problem. Your hacker is probably stuck on something difficult. Don't worry 
  about it. 
  2.1: But it's been two weeks since I saw anything! 
  Your hacker is working, alone probably, on a big project, and just started, 
  right? She's probably trying to figure it all out in advance. Ask her how it's 
  going; if she starts a lot of sentences, but interrupts them all with "no, 
  wait..." or "drat, that won't work", it's going well. 
  2.2: Isn't this damaging to productivity? 
  No. Your hacker needs to recreate and think about things in many ways. He will 
  be more productive with this recreation than without it. Your hacker enjoys 
  working; don't worry about things getting done reasonably well and quickly. 
  2.3: My hacker is constantly doing things unrelated to her job 
  responsibilities. 
  Do they need to be done? Very few hackers can resist solving a problem when 
  they can solve it, and no one else is solving it. For that matter, is your 
  hacker getting her job done? If so, consider these other things a freebie or 
  perk (for you). Although it may not be conventional, it's probably helping out 
  quite a bit. 
  2.4: My hacker is writing a book, reading USENET news, playing video games, 
  talking with friends on the phone, and building sculptures out of paper clips. 
  On company time! 
  He sounds happy. The chances are he's in one of three states: 
    Basic job responsibilities are periodic (phone support, documentation, et 
    al.) and there's a lull in incoming work. Don't worry about it! 
    Your hacker is stuck on a difficult problem. 
    Your hacker is bored silly and is trying to find amusement. Perhaps you 
    should find him more challenging work? 
  Any of these factors may be involved. All of them may be involved. In general, 
  if the work is challenging, and is getting done, don't worry too much about 
  the process. You might ask for your corporation to be given credit in the 
book.
  2.5: But my other workers are offended by my hacker's success, and it hurts 
  their productivity. 
  Do you really need to have workers around who would rather be the person 
  getting something done, than have it done already? Ego has very little place 
  in the workplace. If they can't do it well, assign them to something they can 
  do. 
Section 3: Stimulus and response
  3.0: My hacker did something good, and I want to reward him. 
  Good! Here are some of the things most hackers would like to receive in 
  exchange for their work: 
    Respect. 
    Admiration. 
    Compliments. 
    Understanding. 
    Discounts on expensive toys. 
    Money. 
  These are not necessarily in order. The 4th item (understanding) is the most 
  difficult. Try to remember this good thing your hacker just did the next time 
  you discover he just spent a day playing x-trek. Rather than complaining about 
  getting work done, write it off as "a perk" that was granted (informally) as a 
  bonus for a job well done. Don't worry; hackers get bored quickly when they 
  aren't doing their work.
  3.1: My hacker did something bad, and I want to punish him. 
  Don't. 30 years of psychological research has shown that punishment has no 
  desirable long-term effects. Your hacker is not a lab rat. (Even if he were a 
  lab rat, punishment wouldn't work; at least, not if he were one of the sorts 
  of lab rats the psych research was done on.) If you don't like something your 
  hacker is doing, express your concerns. Explain what it is that bothers you 
  about the behavior. 
  Be prepared for an argument; your hacker is a rational entity, and presumably 
  had reasons. Don't jump on him too quickly; they may turn out to be good 
  reasons.
  Don't be afraid to apologize if you're wrong. If your hacker admits to having 
  been wrong, don't demand an apology; so far as the hacker is concerned, 
  admitting to being wrong is an apology, most likely.
  3.2: I don't get it. I offered my hacker a significant promotion, and she 
  turned it down and acted offended. 
  A promotion frequently involves spending more time listening to people 
  describing what they're doing, and less time playing with computers. Your 
  hacker is enjoying her work; if you want to offer a reward, consider an 
  improvement in title, a possible raise, and some compliments. Make sure your 
  hacker knows you are pleased with her accomplishments -- that's what she's 
  there for. 
  3.3: My company policy won't let me give my hacker any more raises until he's 
  in management. 
  Your company policy is broken. A hacker can earn as much as $200 an hour 
  (sometimes more) doing freelance consulting. You may wish to offer your hacker 
  a contracted permanent consulting position with benefits, or otherwise find 
  loopholes. Or, find perks to offer - many hackers will cheerfully accept a 
  discount on hardware from their favorite manufacturer as an effective raise. 
  3.4: I can't believe the hacker on my staff is worth as much as we're paying. 
  Ask the other staff in the department what the hacker does, and what they 
  think of it. The chances are that your hacker is spending a few hours a week 
  answering arcane questions that would otherwise require an expensive external 
  consultant. Your hacker may be fulfilling another job's worth of 
  responsibilities in his spare time around the office. Very few hackers aren't 
  worth what they're getting paid; they enjoy accomplishing difficult tasks, and 
  improving worker efficiency. 
Section 4: What does that mean?
  4.0: My hacker doesn't speak English. At least, I don't think so. 
  Your hacker is a techie. Your best bet is to pick up a copy of TNHD (The New 
  Hacker's Dictionary). It can be found as http://catb.org/esr/jargon (last I 
  checked) or from a good bookstore. If you have trouble understanding that 
  reference, ask your hacker if she has a copy, or would be willing to explain 
  her terms. Most hackers are willing to explain terms. Be ready for 
  condescension; it's not intended as an insult, but if you don't know the 
  words, she probably has to talk down to you at first to explain them. 
  It's a reasonably difficult set of words; there are a lot of them, and their 
  usage is much more precise than it sounds. Hackers love word games.
  [It is also possible that English is not your hacker's native language, and 
  that it's not yours either. Feel free to substitute a more appropriate 
  language.]
  4.1: I can't get an estimate out of my hacker. 
  Your hacker hasn't figured out how hard the problem is yet. Unlike most 
  workers, hackers will try very hard to refuse to give an estimate until they 
  know for sure that they understand the problem. This may include solving it. 
  No good engineer goes beyond 95% certainty. Most hackers are good engineers. 
  If you say you will not try to hold him to the estimate (and mean it!) you are 
  much more likely to get an approximate estimate. The estimate may sound very 
  high or very low; it may be very high or very low. Still, it's an estimate, 
  and you get what you ask for.
  4.2: My hacker makes obscure, meaningless jokes. 
  If you feel brave, ask for an explanation. Most of them can be explained. It 
  may take a while, but it may prove interesting. 
  4.3: My hacker counts from zero. 
  So does the computer. You can hide it, but computers count from zero. Most 
  hackers do by habit, also.
