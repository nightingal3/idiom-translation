              Part II, Essay VII 
              OF THE BALANCE OF POWER 

              IT is a question whether the idea of the balance of power be owing 
              entirely to modern policy, or whether the phrase only has been 
              invented in these later ages? It is certain, that XENOPHON,*67 in 
              his Institution of CYRUS, represents the combination of the 
              ASIATIC powers to have arisen from a jealousy of the encreasing 
              force of the MEDES and PERSIANS; and though that elegant 
              composition should be supposed altogether a romance,Åã this 
              sentiment, ascribed by the author to the eastern princes, is at 
              least a proof of the prevailing notion of ancient times. 
        II.VII.1
              In all the politics of GREECE, the anxiety, with regard to the 
              balance of power, is apparent, and is expressly pointed out to us, 
              even by the ancient historians. THUCYDIDES*68 represents the 
              league, which was formed against ATHENS, and which produced the 
              PELOPONNESIAN war, as entirely owing to this principle. And after 
              the decline of ATHENS, when the THEBANS and LACEDEMONIANS disputed 
              for sovereignty, we find, that the ATHENIANS (as well as many 
              other republics) always threw themselves into the lighter scale, 
              and endeavoured to preserve the balance. They supported THEBES 
              against SPARTA, till the great victory gained by EPAMINONDAS at 
              LEUCTRA; after which they immediately went over to the conquered, 
              from generosity, as they pretended, but in reality from their 
              jealousy of the conquerors.*69 
        II.VII.2
              Whoever will read DEMOSTHENES'S oration for the MEGALOPOLITANS, 
              may see the utmost refinements on this principle, that ever 
              entered into the head of a VENETIAN or ENGLISH speculatist.*70 And 
              upon the first rise of the MACEDONIAN power, this orator 
              immediately discovered the danger, sounded the alarm throughout 
              all GREECE, and at last assembled that confederacy under the 
              banners of ATHENS, which fought the great and decisive battle of 
              CHAERONEA. 
        II.VII.3
              It is true, the GRECIAN wars are regarded by historians as wars of 
              emulation rather than of politics; and each state seems to have 
              had more in view the honour of leading the rest, than any 
              well-grounded hopes of authority and dominion. If we consider, 
              indeed, the small number of inhabitants in any one republic, 
              compared to the whole, the great difficulty of forming sieges in 
              those times, and the extraordinary bravery and discipline of every 
              freeman among that noble people; we shall conclude, that the 
              balance of power was, of itself, sufficiently secured in GREECE, 
              and needed not to have been guarded with that caution which may be 
              requisite in other ages. But whether we ascribe the shifting of 
              sides in all the GRECIAN republics to jealous emulation or 
              cautious politics, the effects were alike, and every prevailing 
              power was sure to meet with a confederacy against it, and that 
              often composed of its former friends and allies. 
        II.VII.4
              The same principle, call it envy or prudence, which produced the 
              Ostracism of ATHENS, and Petalism of SYRACUSE,*71 and expelled 
              every citizen whose fame or power overtopped the rest; the same 
              principle, I say, naturally discovered itself in foreign politics, 
              and soon raised enemies to the leading state, however moderate in 
              the exercise of its authority. 
        II.VII.5
              The PERSIAN monarch was really, in his force, a petty prince, 
              compared to the GRECIAN republics; and therefore it behoved him, 
              from views of safety more than from emulation, to interest himself 
              in their quarrels, and to support the weaker side in every 
              contest. This was the advice given by ALCIBIADES to 
              TISSAPHERNES,*72 and it prolonged near a century the date of the 
              PERSIAN empire; till the neglect of it for a moment, after the 
              first appearance of the aspiring genius of PHILIP, brought that 
              lofty and frail edifice to the ground, with a rapidity of which 
              there are few instances in the history of mankind. 
        II.VII.6
              The successors of ALEXANDER showed great jealousy ofÅã the balance 
              of power; a jealousy founded on true politics and prudence, and 
              which preserved distinct for several ages the partition made after 
              the death of that famous conqueror. The fortune and ambition of 
              ANTIGONUS*73 threatened them anew with a universal monarchy; but 
              their combination, and their victory at IPSUS saved them. And in 
              subsequent times, we find, that, as the Eastern princes considered 
              the GREEKS and MACEDONIANS as the only real military force, with 
              whom they had any intercourse, they kept always a watchful eye 
              over that part of the world. The PTOLEMIES, in particular, 
              supported first ARATUS and the ACHAEANS, and then CLEOMENES king 
              of SPARTA, from no other view than as a counterbalance to the 
              MACEDONIAN monarchs. For this is the account which POLYBIUS gives 
              of the EGYPTIAN politics.*74 
        II.VII.7
              The reason, why it is supposed, that the ancients were entirely 
              ignorant of the balance of power, seems to be drawn from the ROMAN 
              history more than the GRECIAN; and as the transactions of the 
              former are generally more familiar to us, we have thence formed 
              all our conclusions. It must be owned, that the ROMANS never met 
              with any such general combination or confederacy against them, as 
              might naturally have been expected from the rapid conquests and 
              declared ambition; but were allowed peaceably to subdue their 
              neighbours, one after another, till they extended their dominion 
              over the whole known world. Not to mention the fabulous history of 
              theira ITALIC wars; there was, upon HANNIBAL'S invasion of the 
              ROMAN state, a remarkable crisis, which ought to have called up 
              the attention of all civilized nations. It appeared afterwards 
              (nor was it difficult to be observed at the time)*75 that this was 
              a contest for universal empire; yet no prince or state seems to 
              have been in the least alarmed about the event or issue of the 
              quarrel. PHILIP of MACEDON remained neuter, till he saw the 
              victories of HANNIBAL; and then most imprudently formed an 
              alliance with the conqueror, upon terms still more imprudent. He 
              stipulated, that he was to assist the CARTHAGINIAN state in their 
              conquest of ITALY; after which they engaged to send over forces 
              into GREECE, to assist him in subduing the GRECIAN 
              commonwealths.*76 
        II.VII.8
              The RHODIAN and ACHAEAN republics are much celebrated by ancient 
              historians for their wisdom and sound policy; yet both of them 
              assisted the ROMANS in their wars against PHILIP and ANTIOCHUS. 
              And what may be esteemed still a stronger proof, that this maxim 
              was not generally known in those ages; no ancient author has 
              remarked the imprudence of these measures, nor has even blamed 
              that absurd treaty above-mentioned, made by PHILIP with the 
              CARTHAGINIANS. Princes and statesmen, in all ages, may, 
              before-hand, be blinded in their reasonings with regard to events: 
              But it is somewhat extraordinary, that historians, afterwards, 
              should not form a sounder judgment of them. 
        II.VII.9
              MASSINISSA, ATTALUS, PRUSIAS, in gratifying their private 
              passions, were, all of them, the instruments of the ROMAN 
              greatness; and never seem to have suspected, that they were 
              forging their own chains, while they advanced the conquests of 
              their ally.*77 A simple treaty and agreement between MASSINISSA 
              and the CARTHAGINIANS, so much required by mutual interest, 
              barredÅã the ROMANS from all entrance into AFRICA, and preserved 
              liberty to mankind. 
        II.VII.10
              The only prince we meet with in the ROMAN history, who seems to 
              have understood the balance of power, is HIERO king of SYRACUSE. 
              Though the ally of ROME, he sent assistance to the CARTHAGINIANS, 
              during the war of the auxiliaries; "Esteeming it requisite," says 
              POLYBIUS,*78 "both in order to retain his dominions in SICILY, and 
              to preserve the ROMAN friendship, that CARTHAGE should be safe; 
              lest by its fall the remaining power should be able, without 
              contrast or opposition, to execute every purpose and undertaking. 
              And here he acted with great wisdom and prudence. For that is 
              never, on any account, to be overlooked; nor ought such a force 
              ever to be thrown into one hand, as to incapacitate the 
              neighbouring states from defending their rights against it." Here 
              is the aim of modern politics pointed out in express terms. 
        II.VII.11
              In short, the maxim of preserving the balance of power is founded 
              so much on common sense and obvious reasoning, that it is 
              impossible it could altogether have escaped antiquity, where we 
              find, in other particulars, so many marks of deep penetration and 
              discernment. If it was not so generally known and acknowledged as 
              at present, it had, at least, an influence on all the wiser and 
              more experienced princes and politicians. And indeed, even at 
              present, however generally known and acknowledged among 
              speculative reasoners, it has not, in practice, an authority much 
              more extensive among those who govern the world. 
        II.VII.12
              After the fall of the ROMAN empire, the form of government, 
              established by the northern conquerors, incapacitated them, in a 
              great measure, for farther conquests, and long maintained each 
              state in its proper boundaries. But when vassalage and the feudal 
              militia were abolished, mankind were anew alarmed by the danger of 
              universal monarchy, from the union of so many kingdoms and 
              principalities in the person of the emperor CHARLES.*79 But the 
              power of the house of AUSTRIA, founded on extensive but divided 
              dominions, and their riches, derived chiefly from mines of gold 
              and silver, were more likely to decay, of themselves, from 
              internal defects, than to overthrow all the bulwarks raised 
              against them. In less than a century, the force of that violent 
              and haughty race was shattered, their opulence dissipated, their 
              splendor eclipsed. A new power succeeded,*80 more formidable to 
              the liberties of EUROPE, possessing all the advantages of the 
              former, and labouring under none of its defects; except a share of 
              that spirit of bigotry and persecution, with which the house of 
              AUSTRIA was so long, and still is so much infatuated. 
        II.VII.13
              bIn the general wars, maintained against this ambitious power, 
              GREAT BRITAIN has stood foremost; and she still maintains her 
              station. Beside her advantages of riches and situation, her people 
              are animated with such a national spirit, and are so fully 
              sensible of the blessings of their government, that we may hope 
              their vigour never will languish in so necessary and so just a 
              cause. On the contrary, if we may judge by the past, their 
              passionate ardour seems rather to require some moderation; and 
              they have oftener erred from a laudable excess than from a 
              blameable deficiency. 
        II.VII.14
              In the first place, we seem to have been more possessed with the 
              ancient GREEK spirit of jealous emulation, than actuated by the 
              prudent views of modern politics. Our wars with FRANCE have been 
              begun with justice, and even, perhaps, from necessity; but have 
              always been too far pushed from obstinacy and passion. The same 
              peace, which was afterwards made at RYSWICK in 1697, was offered 
              so early as the year ninety-two; that concluded at UTRECHT in 1712 
              might have been finished on as good conditions at GERTRUYTENBERG 
              in the year eight; and we might have given at FRANKFORT, in 1743, 
              the same terms, which we were glad to accept of at AIX-LA-CHAPELLE 
              in the year forty-eight. Here then we see, that above half of our 
              wars with FRANCE, and all our public debts, are owing more to our 
              own imprudent vehemence, than to the ambition of our neighbours. 
        II.VII.15
              In the second place, we are so declared in our opposition to 
              FRENCH power, and so alert in defence of our allies, that they 
              always reckon upon our force as upon their own; and expecting to 
              carry on war at our expence, refuse all reasonable terms of 
              accommodation. Habent subjectos, tanquam suos; viles, ut 
              alienos.*81 All the world knows, that the factious vote of the 
              House of Commons, in the beginning of the last parliament, with 
              the professed humour of the nation, made the queen of HUNGARY 
              inflexible in her terms, and prevented that agreement with 
              PRUSSIA, which would immediately have restored the general 
              tranquillity of EUROPE.*82 
        II.VII.16
              In the third place, we are such true combatants, that, when once 
              engaged, we lose all concern for ourselves and our posterity, and 
              consider only how we may best annoy the enemy. To mortgage our 
              revenues at so deep a rate, in wars, where we were only 
              accessories, was surely the most fatal delusion, that a nation, 
              which had any pretension to politics and prudence, has ever yet 
              been guilty of. That remedy of funding,Åã if it be a remedy, and 
              not rather a poison, ought, in all reason, to be reserved to the 
              last extremity; and no evil, but the greatest and most urgent, 
              should ever induce us to embrace so dangerous an expedient. 
        II.VII.17
              These excesses, to which we have been carried, are prejudicial; 
              and may, perhaps, in time, become still more prejudicial another 
              way, by begetting, as is usual, the opposite extreme, and 
              rendering us totally careless and supineÅã with regard to the fate 
              of EUROPE. The ATHENIANS, from the most bustling, intriguing, 
              warlike people of GREECE, finding their error in thrusting 
              themselves into every quarrel, abandoned all attention to foreign 
              affairs; and in no contest ever took part on either side, except 
              by their flatteries and complaisance to the victor. 
        II.VII.18
              Enormous monarchiesc are, probably, destructive to human nature; 
              in their progress, in their continuance,*83 and even in their 
              downfal,Åã which never can be very distant from their 
              establishment. The military genius, which aggrandized the 
              monarchy, soon leaves the court, the capital, and the center of 
              such a government; while the wars are carried on at a great 
              distance, and interest so small a part of the state. The ancient 
              nobility, whose affections attach them to their sovereign, live 
              all at court; and never will accept of military employments, which 
              would carry them to remote and barbarous frontiers, where they are 
              distant both from their pleasures and their fortune. The arms of 
              the state, must, therefore, be entrusted to mercenary strangers, 
              without zeal, without attachment, without honour; ready on every 
              occasion to turn them against the prince, and join each desperate 
              malcontent, who offers pay and plunder. This is the necessary 
              progress of human affairs: Thus human nature checks itself in its 
              airy elevation: Thus ambition blindly labours for the destruction 
              of the conqueror, of his family, and of every thing near and dear 
              to him. The BOURBONS, trusting to the support of their brave, 
              faithful, and affectionate nobility, would push their advantage, 
              without reserve or limitation.*84 These, while fired with glory 
              and emulation, can bear the fatigues and dangers of war; but never 
              would submit to languish in the garrisons of HUNGARY or LITHUANIA, 
              forgot at court, and sacrificed to the intrigues of every minion 
              or mistress, who approaches the prince. The troops are filled with 
              CRAVATES and TARTARS, HUSSARS and COSSACS; intermingled, perhaps, 
              with a few soldiers of fortune from the better provinces: And the 
              melancholy fate of the ROMAN emperors, from the same cause, is 
              renewed over and over again, till the final dissolution of the 
              monarchy.
