The SpiderÅfs Thread [Akutagawa Ryunosuke] 


ONE

One day, the Buddha was strolling alone along the edge of a lotus pond in 
Paradise. The blooming lotus flowers in the pond were each pure white like 
jewels, and the place was filled with the indescribably wondrous fragrance 
continually emitted from each flowerÅfs golden center. It was just morning in 
Paradise.

After a time, the Buddha paused at the edge of the pond and from between the 
lotus leaves that covered it saw a glimpse of the state of things below. Now 
this celestial pond just happened to lie directly over Hell, and peering through 
that crystal-clear water was like looking through a magnifying glass at the 
River of Death and the Mountain of Needles and such.

The Buddha saw there, in the depths of Hell, a single man writhing along with 
the other sinners. This man was named Kandata, and he had been a notorious thief 
who had performed murder and arson and other acts of evil. In his past, however, 
he had performed just one good deed: one day, when walking through the deep 
forest, he saw a spider crawling along the road. At first he raised his foot to 
crush it, but suddenly he changed his mind and stopped, saying, ÅgNo, small 
though it may be, a spider, too, has life. It would be a pity to meaninglessly 
end it,Åh and so did not kill it.

Looking down upon the captives in Hell the Buddha recalled this kind act that 
Kandata had performed, and thought to use his good deed as a way to save him 
from his fate. Looking aside, there on a jade-colored lotus leaf he saw a single 
spider, spinning out a web of silver thread. The Buddha carefully took the 
spiderÅfs thread into his hand, and lowered it straight down between the 
jewel-like white lotuses into the depths of Hell.


TWO

Kandata was floating and sinking along with the other sinners in the Lake of 
Blood at the bottom of Hell. It was pitch black no matter which way he looked, 
and the occasional glimpse of light that he would see in the darkness would turn 
out to be just the glint of the terrible Mountain of Needles. How lonely he must 
have felt! All about him was the silence of the grave, the only occasional sound 
being a faint sigh from one of the damned. Those who were so evil as to be sent 
to this place were tired by its various torments, and left without even the 
strength to cry out. Even the great thief Kandata could only squirm like a dying 
frog as he choked in the Lake of Blood.

But one day, raising up his head and glancing at the sky above the lake, in the 
empty darkness Kandata saw a silver spiderÅfs thread being lowered from the 
ceiling so far, far away. The thread seemed almost afraid to be seen, emitting a 
frail, constant light as it came down to just above KandataÅfs head. Seeing this, 
Kandata couldnÅft help but clap his hands in joy. If he were to cling to this 
thread and climb up it, he may be able to climb out of Hell! Perhaps he could 
even climb all the way to Paradise! Then he would never be chased up the 
Mountain of Needles, nor drowned in the Lake of Blood again.

Thinking so, he firmly grasped the spiderÅfs thread with both hands and began to 
climb the thread, higher and higher. Having once been a great thief, he was used 
to tasks such as this. But the distance between Hell and Paradise is tens of 
thousands of miles, and so it would seem that no amount of effort would make 
this an easy journey. After climbing for some time Kandata tired, and couldnÅft 
climb a bit higher. Having no other recourse, he hung there from the thread, 
resting, and while doing so looked down below.

He saw that he had made a good deal of progress. The Lake of Blood that he had 
been trapped in was now hidden in the dark below, and he had even climbed higher 
than the dimly glowing Mountain of Needles. If he could keep up this pace, 
perhaps he could escape from Hell after all. Kandata grasped the thread with 
both hands, and laughingly spoke in a voice that he hadnÅft used in the many 
years since he had come here, ÅgIÅfve done it! IÅfve done it!Åh

Looking down, however, what did he see but an endless queue of sinners, intently 
following him up the thread like a line of ants! Seeing this, surprise and fear 
kept Kandata hanging there for a time with mouth open and eyes blinking like a 
fool. How could this slender spiderÅfs web, which should break even under just 
his weight, support the weight of all these other people? If the thread were to 
snap, all of his effort would be wasted and he would fall back into Hell with 
the others! That just would not do. But even as he thought these thoughts, 
hundreds more, thousands more of the damned came crawling up from the Lake of 
Blood, forming a line and scurrying up the thread. If he didnÅft do something 
fast, surely the thread would snap in the middle and he would fall back down.

Kandata shouted out, ÅgHey! You sinners! This thread is mine! Who said you could 
climb up it? Get off! Get off!Åh

Though the thread had been fine until just then, with these words it snapped 
with a twang right where Kandata held it. Poor Kandata fell headfirst through 
the air, spinning like a top, right down through the darkness. The severed end 
of the silver thread hung there, suspended from heaven, shining with its pale 
light in that moonless, starless sky.


THREE

The Buddha stood in Paradise at the edge of the lotus pond, silently watching 
these events. After Kandata sank like a stone to the bottom of the Lake of 
Blood, he continued his stroll with a sad face. He must have been surprised that 
even after such severe punishment KandataÅfs lack of compassion would lead him 
right back into Hell.

Yet the lotus blossoms in the lotus ponds of Paradise care nothing about such 
matters. Their jewel-like white flowers waved about the feet of the Buddha, and 
each flowerÅfs golden center continuously filled the place with their 
indescribably wondrous fragrance. It was almost noon in Paradise.
