Hans Christian Andersen: The SwineherdThe Swineherd
by
Hans Christian Andersen
(1842)
NCE upon a time lived a poor prince; his kingdom was very small, but it was 
large enough to enable him to marry, and marry he would. It was rather bold of 
him that he went and asked the emperorÅfs daughter: ÅgWill you marry me?Åh but he 
ventured to do so, for his name was known far and wide, and there were hundreds 
of princesses who would have gladly accepted him, but would she do so? Now we 
shall see.  
On the grave of the princeÅfs father grew a rose-tree, the most beautiful of its 
kind. It bloomed only once in five years, and then it had only one single rose 
upon it, but what a rose! It had such a sweet scent that one instantly forgot 
all sorrow and grief when one smelt it. He had also a nightingale, which could 
sing as if every sweet melody was in its throat. This rose and the nightingale 
he wished to give to the princess; and therefore both were put into big silver 
cases and sent to her. 
The emperor ordered them to be carried into the great hall where the princess 
was just playing ÅgVisitors are comingÅh with her ladies-in-waiting; when she saw 
the large cases with the presents therein, she clapped her hands for joy. 
ÅgI wish it were a little pussy cat,Åh she said. But then the rose-tree with the 
beautiful rose was unpacked. 
ÅgOh, how nicely it is made,Åh exclaimed the ladies. 
ÅgIt is more than nice,Åh said the emperor, Ågit is charming.Åh 
The princess touched it and nearly began to cry. 
ÅgFor shame, pa,Åh she said, Ågit is not artificial, it is natural!Åh 
ÅgFor shame, it is naturalÅh repeated all her ladies. 
ÅgLet us first see what the other case contains before we are angry,Åh said the 
emperor; then the nightingale was taken out, and it sang so beautifully that no 
one could possibly say anything unkind about it. 
ÅgSuperbe, charmant,Åh said the ladies of the court, for they all prattled French, 
one worse than the other. 
ÅgHow much the bird reminds me of the musical box of the late lamented empress,Åh 
said an old courtier, Ågit has exactly the same tone, the same execution.Åh 
ÅgYou are right,Åh said the emperor, and began to cry like a little child. 
ÅgI hope it is not natural,Åh said the princess. 
ÅgYes, certainly it is natural,Åh replied those who had brought the presents. 
ÅgThen let it fly,Åh said the princess, and refused to see the prince. 
But the prince was not discouraged. He painted his face, put on common clothes, 
pulled his cap over his forehead, and came back. 
ÅgGood day, emperor,Åh he said, Ågcould you not give me some employment at the 
court?Åh 
ÅgThere are so many,Åh replied the emperor, Ågwho apply for places, that for the 
present I have no vacancy, but I will remember you. But wait a moment; it just 
comes into my mind, I require somebody to look after my pigs, for I have a great 
many.Åh 
Thus the prince was appointed imperial swineherd, and as such he lived in a 
wretchedly small room near the pigsty; there he worked all day long, and when it 
was night he had made a pretty little pot. There were little bells round the 
rim, and when the water began to boil in it, the bells began to play the old 
tune: 
  ÅgA jolly old sow once lived in a sty,
  Three little piggies had she,Åh &c. 
But what was more wonderful was that, when one put a finger into the steam 
rising from the pot, one could at once smell what meals they were preparing on 
every fire in the whole town. That was indeed much more remarkable than the 
rose. When the princess with her ladies passed by and heard the tune, she 
stopped and looked quite pleased, for she also could play it&#8212;in fact, it was the 
only tune she could play, and she played it with one finger. 
ÅgThat is the tune I know,Åh she exclaimed. ÅgHe must be a well-educated swineherd. 
Go and ask him how much the instrument is.Åh 
One of the ladies had to go and ask; but she put on pattens. 
ÅgWhat will you take for your pot?Åh asked the lady. 
ÅgI will have ten kisses from the princess,Åh said the swineherd. 
ÅgGod forbid,Åh said the lady. 
ÅgWell, I cannot sell it for less,Åh replied the swineherd. 
ÅgWhat did he say?Åh said the princess. 
ÅgI really cannot tell you,Åh replied the lady. 
ÅgYou can whisper it into my ear.Åh 
ÅgIt is very naughty,Åh said the princess, and walked off. 
But when she had gone a little distance, the bells rang again so sweetly: 
  ÅgA jolly old sow once lived in a sty,
  Three little piggies had she,Åh &c. 
ÅgAsk him,Åh said the princess, Ågif he will be satisfied with ten kisses from one 
of my ladies.Åh 
ÅgNo, thank you,Åh said the swineherd: Ågten kisses from the princess, or I keep my 
pot.Åh 
ÅgThat is tiresome,Åh said the princess. ÅgBut you must stand before me, so that 
nobody can see it.Åh  
The ladies placed themselves in front of her and spread out their dresses, and 
she gave the swineherd ten kisses and received the pot. 
That was a pleasure! Day and night the water in the pot was boiling; there was 
not a single fire in the whole town of which they did not know what was 
preparing on it, the chamberlainÅfs as well as the shoemakerÅfs. The ladies danced 
and clapped their hands for joy. 
ÅgWe know who will eat soup and pancakes; we know who will eat porridge and 
cutlets; oh, how interesting!Åh 
ÅgVery interesting, indeed,Åh said the mistress of the household. ÅgBut you must 
not betray me, for I am the emperorÅfs daughter.Åh 
ÅgOf course not,Åh they all said. 
The swineherd&#8212;that is to say, the prince&#8212;but they did not know otherwise than 
that he was a real swineherd&#8212;did not waste a single day without doing something; 
he made a rattle, which, when turned quickly round, played all the waltzes, 
galops, and polkas known since the creation of the world. 
ÅgBut that is superbe,Åh said the princess passing by. ÅgI have never heard a more 
beautiful composition. Go down and ask him what the instrument costs; but I 
shall not kiss him again.Åh 
ÅgHe will have a hundred kisses from the princess,Åh said the lady, who had gone 
down to ask him. 
ÅgI believe he is mad,Åh said the princess, and walked off, but soon she stopped. 
ÅgOne must encourage art,Åh she said. ÅgI am the emperorÅfs daughter! Tell him I 
will give him ten kisses, as I did the other day; the remainder one of my ladies 
can give him.Åh 
ÅgBut we do not like to kiss himÅh said the ladies. 
ÅgThat is nonsense,Åh said the princess; Ågif I can kiss him, you can also do it. 
Remember that I give you food and employment.Åh And the lady had to go down once 
more. 
ÅgA hundred kisses from the princess,Åh said the swineherd, Ågor everybody keeps 
his own.Åh 
ÅgPlace yourselves before me,Åh said the princess then. They did as they were 
bidden, and the princess kissed him. 
ÅgI wonder what that crowd near the pigsty means!Åh said the emperor, who had just 
come out on his balcony. He rubbed his eyes and put his spectacles on. 
ÅgThe ladies of the court are up to some mischief, I think. I shall have to go 
down and see.Åh He pulled up his shoes, for they were down at the heels, and he 
was very quick about it. When he had come down into the courtyard he walked 
quite softly, and the ladies were so busily engaged in counting the kisses, that 
all should be fair, that they did not notice the emperor. He raised himself on 
tiptoe.  
ÅgWhat does this mean?Åh he said, when he saw that his daughter was kissing the 
swineherd, and then hit their heads with his shoe just as the swineherd received 
the sixty-eighth kiss. 
ÅgGo out of my sight,Åh said the emperor, for he was very angry; and both the 
princess and the swineherd were banished from the empire. There she stood and 
cried, the swineherd scolded her, and the rain came down in torrents. 
ÅgAlas, unfortunate creature that I am!Åh said the princess, ÅgI wish I had 
accepted the prince. Oh, how wretched I am!Åh 
The swineherd went behind a tree, wiped his face, threw off his poor attire and 
stepped forth in his princely garments; he looked so beautiful that the princess 
could not help bowing to him. 
ÅgI have now learnt to despise you,Åh he said. ÅgYou refused an honest prince; you 
did not appreciate the rose and the nightingale; but you did not mind kissing a 
swineherd for his toys; you have no one but yourself to blame!Åh 
And then he returned into his kingdom and left her behind. She could now sing at 
her leisure: 
  ÅgA jolly old sow once lived in a sty,
  Three little piggies has she,Åh &c.
