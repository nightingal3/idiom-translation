The NighthawkÅfs Star [Miyazawa Kenji] 

Nighthawk was truly an ugly bird. His face was covered in splotches as if he had 
been splattered with miso, and his beak was flat and split all the way back to 
his ears. His legs were so frail that he could not walk at all. He was such a 
sight that just seeing him made other birds uncomfortable.

Now Skylark was not a particularly attractive bird, either, but knowing that he 
looked better than Nighthawk, at least, upon seeing him in the evening he would 
make a sour face and turn away, silently closing his eyes. The smaller, more 
talkative birds would speak of him with contempt right in front of him, saying, 
ÅgLook, itÅfs him again. Would you just look at that? HeÅfs truly a disgrace to 
birds.Åh ÅgIndeed. Look at how big his mouth is! Maybe heÅfs actually some kind of 
frog.Åh

And so on. Now if he had been a real hawk then just mentioning his name would 
cause these insignificant little birds to tremble and go pale and cower and hide 
among the leaves! But Nighthawk wasnÅft a hawk, or even related to the hawks. He 
was actually the elder brother of the beautiful Kingfisher, and of that avian 
jewel, Hummingbird. Hummingbird sipped the nectar of flowers and Kingfisher ate 
fish, but Nighthawk caught and ate bugs. Nighthawk didnÅft have sharp talons or a 
sharp beak, either, so not even the weakest bird was afraid of him.

So one might wonder why he was named so, and the reason is because his wings 
were inordinately strong, and so he resembled a hawk when he soared upon the 
wind. He also had a powerful cry that was not unlike that of a hawk. Hawk, of 
course, was very conscious of this, and hated it. Every time he saw Nighthawk he 
would tell him, ÅgChange your name! Change your name!Åh

One evening, Hawk even came to NighthawkÅfs home. ÅgHey! You there! You still 
havenÅft changed your name! You should be ashamed. WeÅfre completely different, 
you and I. I can fly through the blue sky all day long, and you only come out 
when the sun is clouded over, or at dark. Just look at this beak and these 
talons, and then look at your own!Åh

ÅgMr. Hawk, I canÅft change my name! I didnÅft take this name myself, God gave it 
to me.Åh

ÅgNo, IÅfm the one who got his name from God. In a sense, youÅfre just borrowing my 
name. And NightÅfs. Now give them back.Åh

ÅgI canÅft do that, Mr. Hawk!Åh

ÅgOf course you can. IÅfll give you a good name to take its place. How about 
Leonard? Yeah, Leonard. I like that. So to officially change your name you have 
to make it public, right? To do that you need to hang a sign that says ÅeLeonardÅf 
around your neck, and go around to everyoneÅfs home, bowing and saying ÅeFrom this 
day on, I am to be known as Leonard.ÅfÅh

ÅgI could never do that!Åh

ÅgSure you can! So do it! If you havenÅft done it by the morning of the day after 
tomorrow, IÅfll come and squeeze you to death in my claws. To death, I say! On 
the morning of the day after tomorrow IÅfm going to go to every house and ask if 
youÅfve been by. If I find even one home that you havenÅft visited, that will be 
the end of you!Åh

ÅgBut thereÅfs no way I could do it! I would rather die! Please, just kill me 
now!Åh

ÅgOh, come now, think it over. Leonard is a pretty good name.Åh The hawk spread 
out his wings and flew back towards his nest.

The nighthawk stood there with his eyes closed in thought. Why do they hate me 
so? Because my face looks like itÅfs been splattered with miso, and because my 
beak is odd? Even so, I havenÅft done anything wrong! I remember that day when I 
helped the Whiteeye chick back to its nest after it fell out. Its mother 
snatched it from me as if rescuing her baby from a thief. And then she just 
laughed so hard at me. And now I have to change my name to Leonard? Hang a sign 
about my neck? Oh, how terribleÅc

It was already getting dark. Nighthawk flew from his nest. The clouds glowed 
menacingly, and hung low in the sky. The nighthawk seemed to almost rub against 
them as he silently flew about.

Nighthawk suddenly opened his mouth wide, held his wings out straight, and cut 
across the sky like an arrow. He trapped countless small insects in his mouth. 
Almost as soon as he touched ground he lit off again. The clouds had turned 
gray, and the setting sun colored the faraway mountaintops with crimson fire. 
Nighthawk flew so forcefully that he seemed to slice the sky into two. A beetle 
flew into his mouth and squirmed about. The nighthawk swallowed it down, but for 
some reason doing so sent a chill down his back.

The clouds were now pitch black, and only the mountains to the East cast the 
frightening reflection of the red setting sun. Feeling an ache in his chest, 
Nighthawk again took off into the sky. Again a beetle flew into his mouth, and 
there it squirmed, scratching his throat. After great effort Nighthawk managed 
to swallow the beetle, but doing so caused his heart to leap, and he cried out 
in a loud voice. Crying, he flew around and around, making circles in the sky.

Oh, I kill so many beetles and insects every night. And now IÅfm to be killed by 
the hawk. So this is what it feels like. Oh, I canÅft stand this. IÅfll stop 
eating insects, and starve to death. No, Hawk will kill me before that happens. 
No, before that happens IÅfll fly far, far away.

The red light from the sun spread like water, setting the clouds on fire. 
Nighthawk flew straight to the home of his brother, Kingfisher. When he got 
there Kingfisher had just awoken, and was looking at the burning mountains. 
Seeing Nighthawk land, he spoke: ÅgWell hello, brother. To what do I owe the 
pleasure?Åh

ÅgNothing. I just came to say goodbye. IÅfm leaving for a place far, far away.Åh

ÅgBrother! You canÅft leave! With Hummingbird so far away now, IÅfll be left all 
alone!Åh

ÅgIÅfm sorry, it canÅft be helped. Please, speak no further on this today. And 
please, try not to kill any more fish than is absolutely necessary. Good bye, 
now.Åh

ÅgBrother, whatÅfs wrong with you? Please, stay a little longer.Åh

ÅgNo, staying any longer wonÅft change things. Please give my regards to 
Hummingbird. Goodbye. IÅfm afraid weÅfll never meet again. Goodbye.Åh

Nighthawk returned to his home in tears. The short summer night was already 
coming to an end. The fern leaves absorbed the mist as they waved blue and cold. 
Nighthawk gave a high twitter. He then thoroughly straightened up his nest, 
preened his feathers, and flew from his nest again.

The mist had cleared, and the sun had just risen in the East. Ignoring the 
dizzying brightness, Nighthawk flew like an arrow in that direction.

ÅgMr. Sun, Mr. Sun! Please bring me to you! I donÅft care that IÅfll burn and die. 
Even an ugly body like mine will shine as it burns! Please, take me!Åh

But no matter how far he flew, he didnÅft get any closer to the sun. The sun 
seemed to get smaller and farther, even, and said ÅgNighthawk, isnÅft it? Yes, 
yes, I know your pain. But you should try talking to the stars. YouÅfre not a day 
bird, you know.Åh

Nighthawk tried to give a bow, but suddenly became dizzy and fell back down into 
the fields. He felt as if he were having a dream. He saw his body climbing up to 
between the red and yellow stars, he saw himself blown endlessly by the wind, he 
saw himself trapped in HawkÅfs talons.

Something cold plopped on his face. He opened his eyes. The dew from the pampas 
grass had dripped on him. It was already night, and the sky was blue-black and 
filled with blinking stars. Nighthawk flew back up into the sky. The mountains 
were again red with the setting sun. Nighthawk flew about in that faint glow and 
among the cold light of the stars. Then he flew off again. He headed west, 
straight towards the beautiful constellation of Orion, shouting ÅgOh, star! 
Blue-white star of the West! Please take me to you! I donÅft care that I will be 
burned to death!Åh But Orion just continued singing his heroic song, and didnÅft 
pay Nighthawk the least bit of attention.

The Nighthawk almost began to cry, and spiraled back to the ground. He finally 
landed and took off again, circling once. Then he flew straight towards Canis 
Major in the south, shouting, ÅgOh, Star! Blue star of the South! Please take me 
to you! I donÅft care that I will be burned to death!Åh

The Great Dog blinked blue and purple and yellow and said, ÅgSilence with such 
foolishness. Who do you think you are? YouÅfre just a bird. It would take you 
millions, billions, trillions of years to fly this far with those wings of 
yours!Åh and with that, he turned away.

Disappointed again, Nighthawk spiraled back to the Earth. He then flew back up 
and circled twice. This time he flew north towards Ursa Major, shouting ÅgBlue 
star of the North! Please take me to you!Åh

The Great Bear answered, ÅgDonÅft waste your time with such silliness. You should 
go cool your head. Jumping into an iceberg-filled ocean might help, or if there 
is no ocean near you, try diving into a cup filled with ice water.Åh

Disappointed again, Nighthawk spiraled back to the Earth, and then flew back up 
and circled four times. He then flew east again, towards the eagle Aquila on the 
far bank of the just-risen the Milky Way, shouting, ÅgWhite star of the East! 
Please take me to you! I donÅft care that I will be burned to death!Åh

The Eagle proudly stated, ÅgNo, no, that will never happen. You need a certain 
level of birth to become a star. That and a lot of money.Åh

Nighthawk lost all hope, and closing his wings began to fall to the ground. When 
his weak legs were just a yard from the ground he suddenly twisted back up into 
the heavens like a whirlwind. Upon reaching the high heavens he spun around like 
an eagle attacking a bear and stood his feathers on end. He let out a high, high 
screech. His voice was like a hawkÅfs. The other birds asleep in the fields and 
the forest all woke up and, shaking, looked curiously up into the starry sky.

Nighthawk continued on higher and higher, straight up into the sky. The sun on 
the mountains looked like the glowing end of a cigarette. Nighthawk climbed and 
climbed. The cold froze his breath upon his breast. The air became thinner, 
causing him to beat his wings faster and faster.

Nonetheless, the stars grew no larger. His chest pumped like a bellows. The cold 
and frost pierced him like a sword. His wings grew numb. He opened tear-filled 
eyes and once again looked up at the heavens. And yes, that was the end of him. 
He no longer knew if he was falling or climbing, upside down or right side up, 
or if he was still looking up. But peace filled his heart, and though his bloody 
beak was slightly bent to one side, there was a slight smile on it.

After a time Nighthawk opened his eyes wide. He saw that his body had become a 
beautiful light, blue like a phosphorous flame, burning silently. Just next to 
him was Cassiopeia. From just behind him shined the blue-white light of the 
Milky Way.

And NighthawkÅfs Star burned on. It burned on and forever on. It continues to 
burn, even now.
