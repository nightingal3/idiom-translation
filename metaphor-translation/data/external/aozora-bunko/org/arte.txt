      "Our fine arts were developed, their types and uses were established, in 
      times very different from the present, by men whose power of action upon 
      things was insignificant in comparison with ours. But the amazing growth 
      of our techniques, the adaptability and precision they have attained, the 
      ideas and habits they are creating, make it a certainty that profound 
      changes are impending in the ancient craft of the Beautiful. In all the 
      arts there is a physical component which can no longer be considered or 
      treated as it used to be, which cannot remain unaffected by our modern 
      knowledge and power. For the last twenty years neither matter nor space 
      nor time has been what it was from time immemorial. We must expect great 
      innovations to transform the entire technique of the arts, thereby 
      affecting artistic invention itself and perhaps even bringing about an 
      amazing change in our very notion of art." *

      PREFACE  
      When Marx undertook his critique of the capitalistic mode of production, 
      this mode was in its infancy. Marx directed his efforts in such a way as 
      to give them prognostic value. He went back to the basic conditions 
      underlying capitalistic production and through his presentation showed 
      what could be expected of capitalism in the future. The result was that 
      one could expect it not only to exploit the proletariat with increasing 
      intensity, but ultimately to create conditions which would make it 
      possible to abolish capitalism itself.  
      The transformation of the superstructure, which takes place far more 
      slowly than that of the substructure, has taken more than half a century 
      to manifest in all areas of culture the change in the conditions of 
      production. Only today can it be indicated what form this has taken. 
      Certain prognostic requirements should be met by these statements. 
      However, theses about the art of the proletariat after its assumption of 
      power or about the art of a classless society would have less bearing on 
      these demands than theses about the developmental tendencies of art under 
      present conditions of production. Their dialectic is no less noticeable in 
      the superstructure than in the economy. It would therefore be wrong to 
      underestimate the value of such theses as a weapon. They brush aside a 
      number of outmoded concepts, such as creativity and genius, eternal value 
      and mystery--concepts whose uncontrolled (and at present almost 
      uncontrollable) application would lead to a processing of data in the 
      Fascist sense. The concepts which are introduced into the theory of art in 
      what follows differ from the more familiar terms in that they are 
      completely useless for the purposes of Fascism. They are, on the other 
      hand, useful for the formulation of revolutionary demands in the politics 
      of art.  
      I  
      In principle a work of art has always been reproducible. Manmade artifacts 
      could always be imitated by men. Replicas were made by pupils in practice 
      of their craft, by masters for diffusing their works, and, finally, by 
      third parties in the pursuit of gain. Mechanical reproduction of a work of 
      art, however, represents something new. Historically, it advanced 
      intermittently and in leaps at long intervals, but with accelerated 
      intensity. The Greeks knew only two procedures of technically reproducing 
      works of art: founding and stamping. Bronzes, terra cottas, and coins were 
      the only art works which they could produce in quantity. All others were 
      unique and could not be mechanically reproduced. With the woodcut graphic 
      art became mechanically reproducible for the first time, long before 
      script became reproducible by print. The enormous changes which printing, 
      the mechanical reproduction of writing, has brought about in literature 
      are a familiar story. However, within the phenomenon which we are here 
      examining from the perspective of world history, print is merely a 
      special, though particularly important, case. During the Middle Ages 
      engraving and etching were added to the woodcut; at the beginning of the 
      nineteenth century lithography made its appearance.  
      With lithography the technique of reproduction reached an essentially new 
      stage. This much more direct process was distinguished by the tracing of 
      the design on a stone rather than its incision on a block of wood or its 
      etching on a copperplate and permitted graphic art for the first time to 
      put its products on the market, not only in large numbers as hitherto, but 
      also in daily changing forms. Lithography enabled graphic art to 
      illustrate everyday life, and it began to keep pace with printing. But 
      only a few decades after its invention, lithography was surpassed by 
      photography. For the first time in the process of pictorial reproduction, 
      photography freed the hand of the most important artistic functions which 
      henceforth devolved only upon the eye looking into a lens. Since the eye 
      perceives more swiftly than the hand can draw, the process of pictorial 
      reproduction was accelerated so enormously that it could keep pace with 
      speech. A film operator shooting a scene in the studio captures the images 
      at the speed of an actor's speech. Just as lithography virtually implied 
      the illustrated newspaper, so did photography foreshadow the sound film. 
      The technical reproduction of sound was tackled at the end of the last 
      century. These convergent endeavors made predictable a situation which 
      Paul Valery pointed up in this sentence: "Just as water, gas, and 
      electricity are brought into our houses from far off to satisfy our need 
      in response to a minimal effort, so we shall be supplied with visual or 
      auditory images, which will appear and disappear at a simple movement of 
      the hand, hardly more than a sign" (op. cit., p. 226). Around 1900 
      technical reproduction had reached a standard that not only permitted it 
      to reproduce all transmitted works of art and thus to cause the most 
      profound change in their impact upon the public; it also had captured a 
      place of its own among the artistic processes. For the study of this 
      standard nothing is more revealing than the nature of the repercussions 
      that these two different manifestations--the reproduction of works of art 
      and the art of the film--have had on art in its traditional form.  
      I I  
      Even the most perfect reproduction of a work of art is lacking in one 
      element: its presence in time and space, its unique existence at the place 
      where it happens to be. This unique existence of the work of art 
      determined the history to which it was subject throughout the time of its 
      existence. This includes the changes which it may have suffered in 
      physical condition over the years as well as the various changes in its 
      ownership.<1> The traces of the first can be revealed only by chemical or 
      physical analyses which it is impossible to perform on a reproduction; 
      changes of ownership are subject to a tradition which must be traced from 
      the situation of the original.  
      The presence of the original is the prerequisite to the concept of 
      authenticity. Chemical analyses of the patina of a bronze can help to 
      establish this, as does the proof that a given manuscript of the Middle 
      Ages stems from an archive of the fifteenth century. The whole sphere of 
      authenticity is outside technical-- and, of course, not only technical-- 
      reproducibility.<2> Confronted with its manual reproduction, which was 
      usually branded as a forgery, the original preserved all its authority; 
      not so vis a vis technical reproduction. The reason is twofold. First, 
      process reproduction is more independent of the original than manual 
      reproduction. For example, in photography, process reproduction can bring 
      out those aspects of the original that are unattainable to the naked eye 
      yet accessible to the lens, which is adjustable and chooses its angle at 
      will. And photographic reproduction, with the aid of certain processes, 
      such as enlargement or slow motion, can capture images which escape 
      natural vision. Secondly, technical reproduction can put the copy of the 
      original into situations which would be out of reach for the original 
      itself. Above all, it enables the original to meet the beholder halfway, 
      be it in the form of a photograph or a phonograph record. The cathedral 
      leaves its locale to be received in the studio of a lover of art; the 
      choral production, performed in an auditorium or in the open air, resounds 
      in the drawing room.  
      The situations into which the product of mechanical reproduction can be 
      brought may not touch the actual work of art, yet the quality of its 
      presence is always depreciated. This holds not only for the art work but 
      also, for instance, for a landscape which passes in review before the 
      spectator in a movie. In the case of the art object, a most sensitive 
      nucleus--namely, its authenticity--is interfered with whereas no natural 
      object is vulnerable on that score. The authenticity of a thing is the 
      essence of all that is transmissible from its beginning, ranging from its 
      substantive duration to its testimony to the history which it has 
      experienced. Since the historical testimony rests on the authenticity, the 
      former, too, is jeopardized by reproduction when substantive duration 
      ceases to matter. And what is really jeopardized when the historical 
      testimony is affected is the authority of the object.<3> One might subsume 
      the eliminated element in the term "aura" and go on to say: that which 
      withers in the age of mechanical reproduction is the aura of the work of 
      art. This is a symptomatic process whose significance points beyond the 
      realm of art. One might generalize by saying: the technique of 
      reproduction detaches the reproduced object from the domain of tradition. 
      By making many reproductions it substitutes a plurality of copies for a 
      unique existence. And in permitting the reproduction to meet the beholder 
      or listener in his own particular situation, it reactivates the object 
      reproduced. These two processes lead to a tremendous shattering of 
      tradition which is the obverse of the contemporary crisis and renewal of 
      mankind. Both processes are intimately connected with the contemporary 
      mass movements. Their most powerful agent is the film. Its social 
      significance, particularly in its most positive form, is inconceivable 
      w1thout its destructive, cathartic aspect, that is, the liquidation of the 
      traditional value of the cultural heritage. This phenomenon is most 
      palpable in the great historical films. It extends to ever new positions. 
      In 1927 Abel Gance exclaimed enthusiastically: 'Shakespeare, Rembrandt, 
      Beethoven will make films . . . all legends, all mythologies and all 
      myths, all founders of religion, and the very religions . . . await their 
      exposed resurrection, and the heroes crowd each other at the gate." (Abel 
      Gance, "Le Temps de l'image est venu," *L'Art cinematographique*, Vol. 2, 
      pp. 94 f, Paris, 1927.) Presumably without intending it, he issued an 
      invitation to a far-reaching liquidation.  
      III  
      During long periods of history, the mode of human sense perception changes 
      with humanity's entire mode of existence. The manner in which human sense 
      perception is organized, the medium in which it is accomplished, is 
      determined not only by nature but by historical circumstances as well. The 
      fifth century, with its great shifts of population, saw the birth of the 
      late Roman art industry and the Vienna Genesis, and there developed not 
      only an art different from that of antiquity but also a new kind of 
      perception. The scholars of the Viennese school, Riegl and Wickhoff, who 
      resisted the weight of classical tradition under which these later art 
      forms had been buried, were the first to draw conclusions from them 
      concerning the organization of perception at the time. However 
      far-reaching their insight, these scholars limited themselves to showing 
      the significant, formal hallmark which characterized perception in late 
      Roman times. They did not attempt--and, perhaps, saw no way--to show the 
      social transformations expressed by these changes of perception. The 
      conditions for an analogous insight are more favorable in the present. And 
      if changes in the medium of contemporary perception can be comprehended as 
      decay of the aura, it is possible to show its social causes.  
      The concept of aura which was proposed above with reference to historical 
      objects may usefully be illustrated with reference to the aura of natural 
      ones. We define the aura of the latter as the unique phenomenon of a 
      distance, however close it may be. If, while resting on a summer 
      afternoon, you follow with your eyes a mountain range on the horizon or a 
      branch which casts its shadow over you, you experience the aura of those 
      mountains, of that branch. This image makes it easy to comprehend the 
      social bases of the contemporary decay of the aura. It rests on two 
      circumstances, both of which are related to the increasing significance of 
      the masses in contemporary life. Namely, the desire of contemporary masses 
      to bring things "closer" spatially and humanly, which is just as ardent as 
      their bent toward overcoming the uniqueness of every reality by accepting 
      its reproduction.<4> Every day the urge grows stronger to get hold of an 
      object at very close range by way of its likeness, its reproduction. 
      Unmistakably, reproduction as offered by picture magazines and newsreels 
      differs from the image seen by the unarmed eye. Uniqueness and permanence 
      are as closely linked in the latter as are transitoriness and 
      reproducibility in the former. To pry an object from its shell, to destroy 
      its aura, is the mark of a perception whose "sense of the universal 
      equality of things" has increased to such a degree that it extracts it 
      even from a unique object by means of reproduction. Thus is manifested in 
      the field of perception what in the theoretical sphere is noticeable in 
      the increasing importance of statistics. The adjustment of reality to the 
      masses and of the masses to reality is a process of unlimited scope, as 
      much for thinking as for perception.  
      IV  
      The uniqueness of a work of art is inseparable from its being imbedded in 
      the fabric of tradition. This tradition itself is thoroughly alive and 
      extremely changeable. An ancient statue of Venus, for example, stood in a 
      different traditional context with the Greeks, who made it an object of 
      veneration, than with the clerics of the Middle Ages, who viewed it as an 
      ominous idol. Both of them, however, were equally confronted with its 
      uniqueness, that is, its aura. Originally the contextual integration of 
      art in tradition found its expression in the cult. We know that the 
      earliest art works originated in the service of a ritual--first the 
      magical, then the religious kind. It is significant that the existence of 
      the work of art with reference to its aura is never entirely separated 
      from its ritual function.<5> In other words, the unique value of the 
      "authentic" work of art has its basis in ritual, the location of its 
      original use value. This ritualistic basis, however remote, is still 
      recognizable as secularized ritual even in the most profane forms of the 
      cult of beauty.<6> The secular cult of beauty, developed during the 
      Renaissance and prevailing for three centuries, clearly showed that 
      ritualistic basis in its decline and the first deep crisis which befell 
      it. With the advent of the first truly revolutionary means of 
      reproduction, photography, simultaneously with the rise of socialism, art 
      sensed the approaching crisis which has become evident a century later. At 
      the time, art reacted with the doctrine of l'art pour l'art, that is, with 
      a theology of art. This gave rise to what might be called a negative 
      theology in the form of the idea of "pure" art, which not only denied any 
      social function of art but also any categorizing by subject matter. (In 
      poetry, Mallarm* was the first to take this position.)  
      An analysis of art in the age of mechanical reproduction must do justice 
      to these relationships, for they lead us to an all-important insight: for 
      the first time in world history, mechanical reproduction emancipates the 
      work of art from its parasitical dependence on ritual. To an ever greater 
      degree the work of art reproduced becomes the work of art designed for 
      reproducibility.<7> From a photographic negative, for example, one can 
      make any number of prints; to ask for the "authentic" print makes no 
      sense. But the instant the criterion of authenticity ceases to be 
      applicable to artistic production, the total function of art is reversed. 
      Instead of being based on ritual, it begins to be based on another 
      practice--politics.  
      V  
      Works of art are received and valued on different planes. Two polar types 
      stand out:: with one, the accent is on the cult value; with the other, on 
      the exhibition value of the work.<8> Artistic production begins with 
      ceremonial objects destined to serve in a cult. One may assume that what 
      mattered was their existence, not their being on view. The elk portrayed 
      by the man of the Stone Age on the walls of his cave was an instrument of 
      magic. He did expose it to his fellow men, but in the main it was meant 
      for the spirits. Today the cult value would seem to demand that the work 
      of art remain hidden. Certain statues of gods are accessible only to the 
      priest in the cella; certain Madonnas remain covered nearly all year 
      round; certain sculptures on medieval cathedrals are invisible to the 
      spectator on ground level. With the emancipation of the various art 
      practices from ritual go increasing opportunities for the exhibition of 
      their products. It is easier to exhibit a portrait bust that can be sent 
      here and there than to exhibit the statue of a divinity that has its fixed 
      place in the interior of a temple. The same holds for the painting as 
      against the mosaic or fresco that preceded it. And even though the public 
      presentability of a mass originally may have been just as great as that of 
      a symphony, the latter originated at the moment when its public 
      presentability promised to surpass that of the mass.  
      With the different methods of technical reproduction of a work of art, its 
      fitness for exhibition increased to such an extent that the quantitative 
      shift between its two poles turned into a qualitative transformation of 
      its nature. This is comparable to the situation of the work of art in 
      prehistoric times when, by the absolute emphasis on its cult value, it 
      was, first and foremost, an instrument of magic. Only later did it come to 
      be recognized as a work of art. In the same way today, by the absolute 
      emphasis on its exhibition value the work of art becomes a creation with 
      entirely new functions, among which the one we are conscious of, the 
      artistic function, later may be recognized as incidental.<9> This much is 
      certain: today photography and the film are the most serviceable 
      exemplifications of this new function.  
      V I  
      In photography, exhibition value begins to displace cult value all along 
      the line. But cult value does not give way without resistance. It. retires 
      into an ultimate retrenchment: the human countenance. It is no accident 
      that the portrait was the focal point of early photography. The cult of 
      remembrance of loved ones, absent or dead, offers a last refuge for the 
      cult value of the picture. For the last time the aura emanates from the 
      early photographs in the fleeting expression of a human face. This is what 
      constitutes their melancholy, incomparable beauty. But as man withdraws 
      from the photographic image, the exhibition value for the first time shows 
      its superiority to the ritual value. To have pinpointed this new stage 
      constitutes the incomparable significance of Atget, who, around 1900, took 
      photographs of deserted Paris streets. It has quite justly been said of 
      him that he photographed them like scenes of crime. The scene of a crime, 
      too, is deserted; it is photographed for the purpose of establishing 
      evidence. With Atget, photographs become standard evidence for historical 
      occurrences, and acquire a hidden political significance. They demand a 
      specific kind of approach; free-floating contemplation is not appropriate 
      to them. They stir the viewer; he feels challenged by them in a new way. 
      At the same time picture magazines begin to put up signposts for him, 
      right ones or wrong ones, no matter. For the first time, captions have 
      become obligatory. And it is clear that they have an altogether different 
      character than the title of a painting. The directives which the captions 
      give to those looking at pictures in illustrated magazines soon become 
      even more explicit and more imperative in the film where the meaning of 
      each single picture appears to be prescribed by the sequence of all 
      preceding ones.  
      VII  
      The nineteenth-century dispute as to the artistic value of painting versus 
      photography today seems devious and confused. This does not diminish its 
      importance, however; if anything, it underlines it. The dispute was in 
      fact the symptom of a historical transformation the universal impact of 
      which was not realized by either of the rivals. When the age of mechanical 
      reproduction separated art from its basis in cult, the semblance of its 
      autonomy disappeared forever. The resulting change in the function of art 
      transcended the perspective of the century; for a long time it even 
      escaped that of the twentieth century, which experienced the development 
      of the film.  
      Earlier much futile thought had been devoted to the question of whether 
      photography is an art. The primary question-- whether the very invention 
      of photography had not transformed the entire nature of art--was not 
      raised. Soon the film theoreticians asked the same ill-considered question 
      with regard to the film. But the difficulties which photography caused 
      traditional aesthetics were mere child's play as compared to those raised 
      by the film. Whence the insensitive and forced character of early theories 
      of the film. Abel Gance, for instance, compares the film with hieroglyphs: 
      "Here, by a remarkable regression, we have come back to the level of 
      expression of the Egyptians.... Pictorial language has not yet matured 
      because our eyes have not yet adjusted to it. There is as yet insufficient 
      respect for, insufficient cult of, what it expresses." (Abel Gance, op. 
      cit., pp. 100-1.) Or, in the words of S*verin-Mars: "What art has been 
      granted a dream more poetical and more real at the same time! Approached 
      in this fashion the film might represent an incomparable means of 
      expression. Only the most high-minded persons, in the most perfect and 
      mysterious moments of their lives, should be allowed to enter its 
      ambiance." (Severin-Mars, quoted by Abel Gance, op. cit.., p. 100.) 
      Alexandre Arnoux concludes his fantasy about the silent film with the 
      question: "Do not all the bold descriptions we have given amount to the 
      definition of prayer?" (Alexandre Arnoux, Cin*ma pris, 1929, p. 28.) It is 
      instructive to note how their desire to class the film among the "arts" 
      forces these theoreticians to read ritual elements into it--with a 
      striking lack of discretion. Yet when these speculations were published, 
      films like L'Opinion publique and The Gold Rush had already appeared. 
      This, however, did not keep Abel Gance from adducing hieroglyphs for 
      purposes of comparison, nor S*verin-Mars from speaking of the film as one 
      might speak of paintings by Fra Angelico. Characteristically, even today 
      ultrareactionary authors give the film a similar contextual 
      significance--if not an outright sacred one, then at least a supernatural 
      one. Commenting on Max Reinhardt's film version of *A Midsummer Night's 
      Dream*, Werfel states that undoubtedly it was the sterile copying of the 
      exterior world with its streets, interiors, railroad stations, 
      restaurants, motorcars, and beaches which until now had obstructed the 
      elevation of the film to the realm of art. "The film has not yet realized 
      its true meaning, its real possibilities . . . these consist in its unique 
      faculty to express by natural means and with incomparable persuasiveness 
      all that is fairylike, marvelous, supernatural." (Franz Werfel, "Ein 
      Sommernachtstraum, Ein Film von Shakespeare und Reinhardt," *Neues Wiener 
      Journal*, cited in *Lu* 15, November, 1935.)  
      VIII  
      The artistic performance of a stage actor is definitely presented to the 
      public by the actor in person; that of the screen actor, however, is 
      presented by a camera, with a twofold consequence. The camera that 
      presents the performance of the film actor to the public need not respect 
      the performance as an integral whole. Guided by the cameraman, the camera 
      continually changes its position with respect to the performance. The 
      sequence of positional views which the editor composes from the material 
      supplied him constitutes the completed film. It comprises certain factors 
      of movement which are in reality those of the camera, not to mention 
      special camera angles, close-ups, etc. Hence, the performance of the actor 
      is subjected to a series of optical tests. This is the first consequence 
      of the fact that the actor's performance is presented by means of a 
      camera. Also, the film actor lacks the opportunity of the stage actor to 
      adjust to the audience during his performance, since he does not present 
      his performance to the audience in person. This permits the audience to 
      take the position of a critic, without experiencing any personal contact 
      with the actor. The audience's identification with the actor is really an 
      identification with the camera. Consequently the audience takes the 
      position of the camera; its approach is that of testing.<10> This is not 
      the approach to which cult values may be exposed.  
      IX  
      For the film, what matters primarily is that the actor represents himself 
      to the public before the camera, rather than representing someone else. 
      One of the first to sense the actor's metamorphosis by this form of 
      testing was Pirandello. Though his remarks on the subject in his novel *Si 
      Gira* were limited to the negative aspects of the question and to the 
      silent film only, this hardly impairs their validity. For in this respect, 
      the sound film did not change anything essential. What matters is that the 
      part is acted not for an audience but for a mechanical contrivance-- in 
      the case of the sound film, for two of them. "The film actor," wrote 
      Pirandello, "feels as if in exile--exiled not only from the stage but also 
      from himself. With a vague sense of discomfort he feels inexplicable 
      emptiness: his body loses its corporeality, it evaporates, it is deprived 
      of reality, life, voice, and the noises caused by his moving about, in 
      order to be changed into a mute image, flickering an instant on the 
      screen, then vanishing into silence.... The projector will play with his 
      shadow before the public, and he himself must be content to play before 
      the camera" (Luigi Pirandello, *Si Gira*, quoted by Leon Pierre-Quint, 
      "Signification du cinema," *L'Art cinematographique*, op. cit., pp. 
      14-15). This situation might also be characterized as follows: for the 
      first time--and this is the effect of the film--man has to operate with 
      his whole living person, yet forgoing its aura. For aura is tied to his 
      presence; there can be no replica of it. The aura which, on the stage, 
      emanates from Macbeth, cannot be separated for the spectators from that of 
      the actor. However, the singularity of the shot in the studio is that the 
      camera is substituted for the public. Consequently, the aura that envelops 
      the actor vanishes, and with it the aura of the figure he portrays.  
      It is not surprising that it should be a dramatist such as Pirandello who, 
      in characterizing the film, inadvertently touches on the very crisis in 
      which we see the theater. Any thorough study proves that there is indeed 
      no greater contrast than that of the stage play to a work of art that is 
      completely subject to or, like the film, founded in, mechanical 
      reproduction. Experts have long recognized that in the film "the greatest 
      effects are almost always obtained by 'acting' as little as possible...." 
      In 1932 Rudolf Arnheim saw "the latest trend . . . in treating the actor 
      as a stage prop chosen for its characteristics and . . . inserted at the 
      proper place.<11> With this idea something else is closely connected. The 
      stage actor identifies himself with the character of his role. The film 
      actor very often is denied this opportunity. His creation is by no means 
      all of a piece; it is composed of many separate performances. Besides 
      certain fortuitous considerations, such as cost of studio, availability of 
      fellow players, decor, etc., there are elementary necessities of equipment 
      that split the actor's work into a series of mountable episodes. In 
      particular, lighting and its installation require the presentation of an 
      event that, on the screen, unfolds as a rapid and unified scene, in a 
      sequence of separate shootings which may take hours at the studio; not to 
      mention more obvious montage. Thus a jump from the window can be shot in 
      the studio as a jump from a scaffold, and the ensuing flight, if need be, 
      can be shot weeks later when outdoor scenes are taken. Far more 
      paradoxical cases can easily be construed. Let us assume that an actor is 
      supposed to be startled by a knock at the door. If his reaction is not 
      satisfactory, the director can resort to an expedient: when the actor 
      happens to be at the studio again he has a shot fired behind him without 
      his being forewarned of it. The frightened reaction can be shot now and be 
      cut into the screen version. Nothing more strikingly shows that art has 
      left the realm of the "beautiful semblance" which, so far, had been taken 
      to be the only sphere where art could thrive.  
      X  
      The feeling of strangeness that overcomes the actor before the camera, as 
      Pirandello describes it, is basically of the same kind as the estrangement 
      felt before one's own image in the mirror. But now the reflected image has 
      become separable, transportable. And where is it transported? Before the 
      public.<12> Never for a moment does the screen actor cease to be conscious 
      of this fact. While facing the camera he knows that ultimately he will 
      face the public, the consumers who constitute the market. This market, 
      where he offers not only his labor but also his whole self, his heart and 
      soul, is beyond his reach. During the shooting he has as little contact 
      with it as any article made in a factory. This may contribute to that 
      oppression, that new anxiety which, according to Pirandello, grips the 
      actor before the camera. The film responds to the shriveling of the aura 
      with an artificial build-up of the "personality" outside the studio. The 
      cult of the movie star, fostered by the money of the film industry, 
      preserves not the unique aura of the person but the "spell of the 
      personality," the phony spell of a commodity. So long as the movie-makers' 
      capital sets the fashion, as a rule no other revolutionary merit can be 
      accredited to today's film than the promotion of a revolutionary criticism 
      of traditional concepts of art. We do not deny that in some cases today's 
      films can also promote revolutionary criticism of social conditions, even 
      of the distribution of property. However, our present study is no more 
      specifically concerned with this than is the film production of Western 
      Europe.  
      It is inherent in the technique of the film as well as that of sports that 
      everybody who witnesses its accomplishments is somewhat of an expert. This 
      is obvious to anyone listening to a group of newspaper boys leaning on 
      their bicycles and discussing the outcome of a bicycle race. It is not for 
      nothing that newspaper publishers arrange races for their delivery boys. 
      These arouse great interest among the participants, for the victor has an 
      opportunity to rise from delivery boy to professional racer. Similarly, 
      the newsreel offers everyone the opportunity to rise from passer- by to 
      movie extra. In this way any man might even find himself part of a work of 
      art, as witness Vertoff's *Three Songs About Lenin* or Ivens' *Borinage*. 
      Any man today can lay claim to being filmed. This claim can best be 
      elucidated by a comparative look at the historical situation of 
      contemporary literature.  
      For centuries a small number of writers were confronted by many thousands 
      of readers. This changed toward the end of the last century. With the 
      increasing extension of the press, which kept placing new political, 
      religious, scientific, professional, and local organs before the readers, 
      an increasing number of readers became writers--at first, occasional ones. 
      It began with the daily press opening to its readers space for "letters to 
      the editor." And today there is hardly a gainfully employed European who 
      could not, in principle, find an opportunity to publish somewhere or other 
      comments on his work, grievances, documentary reports, or that sort of 
      thing. Thus, the distinction between author and public is about to lose 
      its basic character. The difference becomes merely functional; it may vary 
      from case to case. At any moment the reader is ready to turn into a 
      writer. As expert, which he had to become willy-nilly in an extremely 
      specialized work process, even if only in some minor respect, the reader 
      gains access to authorship. In the Soviet Union work itself is given a 
      voice. To present it verbally is part of a man's ability to perform the 
      work. Literary license is now founded on polytechnic rather than 
      specialized training and thus becomes common property.<13> 
      All this can easily be applied to the film, where transitions that in 
      literature took centuries have come about in a decade. In cinematic 
      practice, particularly in Russia, this change-over has partially become 
      established reality. Some of the players whom we meet in Russian films are 
      not actors in our sense but people who portray *themselves*--and primarily 
      in their own work process. In Western Europe the capitalistic exploitation 
      of the film denies consideration to modern man's legitimate claim to being 
      reproduced. Under these circumstances the film industry is trying hard to 
      spur the interest of the masses through illusion-promoting spectacles and 
      dubious speculations.  
      XI  
      The shooting of a film, especially of a sound film, affords a spectacle 
      unimaginable anywhere at any time before this. It presents a process in 
      which it is impossible to assign to a spectator a viewpoint which would 
      exclude from the actual scene such extraneous accessories as camera 
      equipment, lighting machinery, staff assistants, etc.--unless his eye were 
      on a line parallel with the lens. This circumstance, more than any other, 
      renders superficial and insignificant any possible similarity between a 
      scene in the studio and one on the stage. In the theater one is well aware 
      of the place from which the play cannot immediately be detected as 
      illusionary. There is no such place for the movie scene that is being 
      shot. Its illusionary nature is that of the second degree, the result of 
      cutting. That is to say, in the studio the mechanical equipment has 
      penetrated so deeply into reality that its pure aspect freed from the 
      foreign substance of equipment is the result of a special procedure, 
      namely, the shooting by the specially adjusted camera and the mounting of 
      the shot together with other similar ones. The equipment-free aspect of 
      rea1ity here has become the height of artifice; the sight of immediate 
      reality has become an orchid in the land of technology.  
      Even more revealing is the comparison of these circumstances, which differ 
      so much from those of the theater, with the situation in painting. Here 
      the question is: How does the cameraman compare with the painter? To 
      answer this we take recourse to an analogy with a surgical operation. The 
      surgeon represents the polar opposite of the magician. The magician heals 
      a sick person by the laying on of hands; the surgeon cuts into the 
      patients body. The magician maintains the natural distance between the 
      patient and himself; though he reduces it very slightly by the laying on 
      of hands, he greatly increases it by virtue of his authority. The surgeon 
      does exactly the reverse; he greatly diminishes the distance between 
      himself and the patient by penetrating into the patient's body, and 
      increases it but little by the caution with which his hand moves among the 
      organs. In short, in contrast to the magician--who is still hidden in the 
      medical practitioner--the surgeon at the decisive moment abstains from 
      facing the patient man to man; rather, it is through the operation that he 
      penetrates into him.  
      Magician and surgeon compare to painter and cameraman. The painter 
      maintains in his work a natural distance from reality, the cameraman 
      penetrates deeply into its web.<14> There is a tremendous difference 
      between the pictures they obtain. That of the painter is a total one, that 
      of the cameraman consists of multiple fragments which are assembled under 
      a new law. Thus, for contemporary man the representation of reality by the 
      film is incomparably more significant than that of the painter, since it 
      offers, precisely because of the thoroughgoing permeation of reality with 
      mechanical equipment, an aspect of reality which is free of all equipment. 
      And that is what one is entitled to ask from a work of art.  
      XII  
      Mechanical reproduction of art changes the reaction of the masses toward 
      art. The reactionary attitude toward a Picasso painting changes into the 
      progressive reaction toward a Chaplin movie. The progressive reaction is 
      characterized by the direct, intimate fusion of visual and emotional 
      enjoyment with the orientation of the expert. Such fusion is of great 
      social significance. The greater the decrease in the social significance 
      of an art form, the sharper the distinction between criticism and 
      enjoyment by the public. The conventional is uncritically enjoyed, and the 
      truly new is criticized with aversion. With regard to the screen the 
      critical and the receptive attitudes of the public coincide. The decisive 
      reason for this is that individual reactions are predetermined by the mass 
      audience response they are about to produce, and this is nowhere more 
      pronounced than in the film. The moment these responses become manifest 
      they control each other. Again, the comparison with painting is fruitful. 
      A painting has always had an excellent chance to be viewed by one person 
      or by a few. The simultaneous contemplation of paintings by a large 
      public, such as developed in the nineteenth century, is an early symptom 
      of the crisis of painting, a crisis which was by no means occasioned 
      exclusively by photography but rather in a relatively independent manner 
      by the appeal of art works to the masses.  
      Painting simply is in no position to present an object for simultaneous 
      collective experience, as it was possible for architecture at all times, 
      for the epic poem in the past, and for the movie today. Although this 
      circumstance in itself should not lead one to conclusions about the social 
      role of painting, it does constitute a serious threat as soon as painting, 
      under special conditions and, as it were, against its nature, is 
      confronted directly by the masses. In the churches and monasteries of the 
      Middle Ages and at the princely courts up to the end of the eighteenth 
      century, a collective reception of paintings did not occur simultaneously, 
      but by graduated and hierarchized mediation. The change that has come 
      about is an expression of the particular conflict in which painting was 
      implicated by the mechanical reproducibility of paintings. Although 
      paintings began to be publicly exhibited in galleries and salons, there 
      was no way for the masses to organize and control themselves in their 
      reception.<15> Thus the same public which responds in a progressive manner 
      toward a grotesque film is bound to respond in a reactionary manner to 
      surrealism.  
      XIII  
      The characteristics of the film lie not only in the manner in which man 
      presents himself to mechanical equipment but also in the manner in which, 
      by means of this apparatus, man can represent his environment. A glance at 
      occupational psychology illustrates the testing capacity of the equipment. 
      Psychoanalysis illustrates it in a different perspective. The film has 
      enriched our field of perception with methods which can be illustrated by 
      those of Freudian theory. Fifty years ago, a slip of the tongue passed 
      more or less unnoticed. Only exceptionally may such a slip have revealed 
      dimensions of depth in a conversation which had seemed to be taking its 
      course on the surface. Since the *Psychopathology of Everyday Life* things 
      have changed. This book isolated and made analyzable things which had 
      heretofore floated along unnoticed in the broad stream of perception. For 
      the entire spectrum of optical, and now also acoustical, perception the 
      film has brought about a similar deepening of apperception. It is only an 
      obverse of this fact that behavior items shown in a movie can be analyzed 
      much more precisely and from more points of view than those presented on 
      paintings or on the stage. As compared with painting, filmed behavior 
      lends itself more readily to analysis because of its incomparably more 
      precise statements of the situation. In comparison with the stage scene, 
      the filmed behavior item lends itself more readily to analysis because it 
      can be isolated more easily. This circumstance derives its chief 
      importance from its tendency to promote the mutual penetration of art and 
      science. Actually, of a screened behavior item which is neatly brought out 
      in a certain situation, like a muscle of a body, it is difficult to say 
      which is more fascinating, its artistic value or its value for science. To 
      demonstrate the identity of the artistic and scientific uses of 
      photography which heretofore usually were separated will be one of the 
      revolutionary functions of the film.<16> 
      By close-ups of the things around us, by focusing on hidden details of 
      familiar objects, by exploring commonplace milieus under the ingenious 
      guidance of the camera, the film, on the one hand, extends our 
      comprehension of the necessities which rule our lives; on the other hand, 
      it manages to assure us of an immense and unexpected field of action. Our 
      taverns and our metropolitan streets, our offices and furnished rooms, our 
      railroad stations and our factories appeared to have us locked up 
      hopelessly. Then came the film and burst this prison-world asunder by the 
      dynamite of the tenth of a second, so that now, in the midst of its 
      far-flung ruins and debris, we calmly and adventurously go traveling. With 
      the close-up, space expands; with slow motion, movement is extended. The 
      enlargement of a snapshot does not simply render more precise what in any 
      case was visible, though unclear: it reveals entirely new structural 
      formations of the subject. So, too, slow motion not only presents familiar 
      qualities of movement but reveals in them entirely unknown ones "which, 
      far from looking like retarded rapid movements give the effect of 
      singularly gliding, floating, supernatural motions. (Rudolf Arnheim, loc. 
      cit., p. 138.) Evidently a different nature opens itself to the camera 
      than opens to the naked eye--if only because an unconsciously penetrated 
      space is substituted for a space consciously explored by man. Even if one 
      has a general knowledge of the way people walk, one knows nothing of a 
      person's posture during the fractional second of a stride. The act of 
      reaching for a lighter or a spoon is familiar routine, yet we hardly know 
      what really goes on between hand and metal, not to mention how this 
      fluctuates with our moods. Here the camera intervenes with the resources 
      of its lowerings and liftings, its interruptions and isolations, its 
      extensions and accelerations, its enlargements and reductions. The camera 
      introduces us to unconscious optics as does psychoanalysis to unconscious 
      impulses.  
      XIV  
      One of the foremost tasks of art has always been the creation of a demand 
      which could be fully satisfied only later.<17> The history of every art 
      form shows critical epochs in which a certain art form aspires to effects 
      which could be fully obtained only with a changed technical standard, that 
      is to say, in a new art form. The extravagances and crudities of art which 
      thus appear, particularly in the so-called decadent epochs, actually arise 
      from the nucleus of its richest historical energies. In recent years, such 
      barbarisms were abundant in Dadaism. It is only now that its impulse 
      becomes discernible: Dadaism attempted to create by pictorial--and 
      literary--means the effects which the public today seeks in the film.  
      Every fundamentally new, pioneering creation of demands will carry beyond 
      its goal. Dadaism did so to the extent that it sacrificed the market 
      values which are so characteristic of the film in favor of higher 
      ambitions-- though of course it was not conscious of such intentions as 
      here described. The Dadaists attached much less importance to the sales 
      value of their work than to its uselessness for contemplative immersion. 
      The studied degradation of their material was not the least of their means 
      to achieve this uselessness. Their poems are "word salad" containing 
      obscenities and every imaginable waste product of language. The same is 
      true of their paintings, on which they mounted buttons and tickets. What 
      they intended and achieved was a relentless destruction of the aura of 
      their creations, which they branded as reproductions with the very means 
      of production. Before a painting of Arp's or a poem by August Stramm it is 
      impossible to take time for contemplation and evaluation as one would 
      before a canvas of Derain's or a poem by Rilke. In the decline of 
      middleclass society, contemplation became a school for asocial behavior; 
      it was countered by distraction as a variant of social conduct.<18> 
      Dadaistic activities actually assured a rather vehement distraction by 
      making works of art the center of scandal. One requirement was foremost: 
      to outrage the public.  
      From an alluring appearance or persuasive structure of sound the work of 
      art of the Dadaists became an instrument of ballistics. It hit the 
      spectator like a bullet, it happened to him, thus acquiring a tactile 
      quality. It promoted a demand for the film, the distracting element of 
      which is also primarily tactile, being based on changes of place and focus 
      which periodically assail the spectator. Let us compare the screen on 
      which a film unfolds with the canvas of a painting. The painting invites 
      the spectator to contemplation; before it the spectator can abandon 
      himself to his associations. Before the movie frame he cannot do so. No 
      sooner has his eye grasped a scene than it is already changed. It cannot 
      be arrested. Duhamel, who detests the film and knows nothing of its 
      significance, though something of its structure, notes this circumstance 
      as follows: "I can no longer think what I want to think. My thoughts have 
      been replaced by moving images." (Georges Duhamel, *Scenes de la vie 
      future*, Paris, 1930, p. 52.) The spectator's process of association in 
      view of these images is indeed interrupted by their constant, sudden 
      change. This constitutes the shock effect of the film, which, like all 
      shocks, should be cushioned by heightened presence of mind.<19> By means 
      of its technical structure, the film has taken the physical shock effect 
      out of the wrappers in which Dadaism had, as it were, kept it inside the 
      moral shock effect.<20> 
      XV  
      The mass is a matrix from which all traditional behavior toward works of 
      art issues today in a new form. Quantity has been transmuted into quality. 
      The greatly increased mass of participants has produced a change in the 
      mode of participation. The fact that the new mode of participation first 
      appeared in a disreputable form must not confuse the spectator. Yet some 
      people have launched spirited attacks against precisely this superficial 
      aspect. Among these, Duhamel has expressed himself in the most radical 
      manner. What he objects to most is the kind of participation which the 
      movie elicits from the masses. Duhamel calls the movie "a pastime for 
      helots, a diversion for uneducated, wretched, worn-out creatures who are 
      consumed by their worries . . ., a spectacle which requires no 
      concentration and presupposes no intelligence . . ., which kindles no 
      light in the heart and awakens no hope other than the ridiculous one of 
      someday becoming a 'star' in Los Angeles." (Duhamel, op. cit., p. 58.) 
      Clearly, this is at bottom the same ancient lament that the masses seek 
      distraction whereas art demands concentration from the spectator. That is 
      a commonplace. The question remains whether it provides a platform for the 
      analysis of the film. A closer look is needed here. Distraction and 
      concentration form polar opposites which may be stated as follows: A man 
      who concentrates before a work of art is absorbed by it. He enters into 
      this work of art the way legend tells of the Chinese painter when he 
      viewed his finished painting. In contrast, the distracted mass absorbs the 
      work of art. This is most obvious with regard to buildings. Architecture 
      has always represented the prototype of a work of art the reception of 
      which is consummated by a collectivity in a state of distraction. The laws 
      of its reception are most instructive.  
      Buildings have been man's companions since primeval times. Many art forms 
      have developed and perished. Tragedy begins with the Greeks, is 
      extinguished with them, and after centuries its "rules" only are revived. 
      The epic poem, which had its origin in the youth of nations, expires in 
      Europe at the end of the Renaissance. Panel painting is a creation of the 
      Middle Ages, and nothing guarantees its uninterrupted existence. But the 
      human need for shelter is lasting. Architecture has never been idle. Its 
      history is more ancient than that of any other art, and its claim to being 
      a living force has significance in every attempt to comprehend the 
      relationship of the masses to art. Buildings are appropriated in a twofold 
      manner: by use and by perception-- or rather, by touch and sight. Such 
      appropriation cannot be understood in terms of the attentive concentration 
      of a tourist before a famous building. On the tactile side there is no 
      counterpart to contemplation on the optical side. Tactile appropriation is 
      accomplished not so much by attention as by habit. As regards 
      architecture, habit determines to a large extent even optical reception. 
      The latter, too, occurs much less through rapt attention than by noticing 
      the object in incidental fashion. This mode of appropriation, developed 
      with reference to architecture, in certain circumstances acquires 
      canonical value. For the tasks which face the human apparatus of 
      perception at the turning points of history cannot be solved by optical 
      means, that is, by contemplation, alone. They are mastered gradually by 
      habit, under the guidance of tactile appropriation.  
      The distracted person, too, can form habits. More, the ability to master 
      certain tasks in a state of distraction proves that their solution has 
      become a matter of habit. Distraction as provided by art presents a covert 
      control of the extent to which new tasks have become soluble by 
      apperception. Since, moreover, individuals are tempted to avoid such 
      tasks, art will tackle the most difficult and most important ones where it 
      is able to mobilize the masses. Today it does so in the film. Reception in 
      a state of distraction, which is increasing noticeably in all fields of 
      art and is symptomatic of profound changes in apperception, finds in the 
      film its true means of exercise. The film with its shock effect meets this 
      mode of reception halfway. The film makes the cult value recede into the 
      background not only by putting the public in the position of the critic, 
      but also by the fact that at the movies this position requires no 
      attention. The public is an examiner, but an absent-minded one.  
      EPILOGUE  
      The growing proletarianization of modern man and the increasing formation 
      of masses are two aspects of the same process. Fascism attempts to 
      organize the newly created proletarian masses without affecting the 
      property structure which the masses strive to eliminate. Fascism sees its 
      salvation in giving these masses not their right, but instead a chance to 
      express themselves.<21> The masses have a right to change property 
      relations; Fascism seeks to give them an expression while preserving 
      property. The logical result of Fascism is the introduction of aesthetics 
      into political life. The violation of the masses, whom Fascism, with its 
      *Fuhrer* cult, forces to their knees, has its counterpart in the violation 
      of an apparatus which is pressed into the production of ritual values.  
      All efforts to render politics aesthetic culminate in one thing: war. War 
      and war only can set a goal for mass movements on the largest scale while 
      respecting the traditional property system. This is the political formula 
      for the situation. The technological formula may be stated as follows: 
      Only war makes it possible to mobilize all of today's technical resources 
      while maintaining the property system. It goes without saying that the 
      Fascist apotheosis of war does not employ such arguments. Still, Marinetti 
      says in his manifesto on the Ethiopian colonial war: "For twenty- seven 
      years we Futurists have rebelled against the branding of war as 
      antiaesthetic.... Accordingly we state: ... War is beautiful because it 
      establishes man's dominion over the subjugated machinery by means of gas 
      masks, terrifying megaphones, flame throwers, and small tanks. War is 
      beautiful because it initiates the dreamt-of metalization of the human 
      body. War is beautiful because it enriches a flowering meadow with the 
      fiery orchids of machine guns. War is beautiful because it combines the 
      gunfire, the cannonades, the cease-fire, the scents, and the stench of 
      putrefaction into a symphony. War is beautiful because it creates new 
      architecture, like that of the big tanks, the geometrical formation 
      flights, the smoke spirals from burning villages, and many others.... 
      Poets and artists of Futurism! ... remember these principles of an 
      aesthetics of war so that your struggle for a new literature and a new 
      graphic art . . . may be illumined by them!"  
      This manifesto has the virtue of clarity. Its formulations deserve to be 
      accepted by dialecticians. To the latter, the aesthetics of today's war 
      appears as follows: If the natural utilization of productive forces is 
      impeded by the property system, the increase in technical devices, in 
      speed, and in the sources of energy will press for an unnatural 
      utilization, and this is found in war. The destructiveness of war 
      furnishes proof that society has not been mature enough to incorporate 
      technology as its organ, that technology has not been sufficiently 
      developed to cope with the elemental forces of society. The horrible 
      features of imperialistic warfare are attributable to the discrepancy 
      between the tremendous means of production and their inadequate 
      utilization in the process of production--in other words, to unemployment 
      and the lack of markets. Imperialistic war is a rebellion of technology 
      which collects, in the form of "human material," the claims to which 
      society has denied its natural material. Instead of draining rivers, 
      society directs a human stream into a bed of trenches; instead of dropping 
      seeds from airplanes, it drops incendiary bombs over cities; and through 
      gas warfare the aura is abolished in a new way.  
      "*Fiat ars--pereat mundus*," says Fascism, and, as Marinetti admits, 
      expects war to supply the artistic gratification of a sense perception 
      that has been changed by technology. This is evidently the consummation of 
      "*I'art pour l'art*." Mankind, which in Homer's time was an object of 
      contemplation for the Olympian gods, now is one for itself. Its 
      self-alienation has reached such a degree that it can experience its own 
      destruction as an aesthetic pleasure of the first order. This is the 
      situation of politics which Fascism is rendering aesthetic. Communism 
      responds by politicizing art.  
      Notes  
      1. Of course, the history of a work of art encompasses more than this. The 
      history of the "Mona Lisa," for instance, encompasses the kind and number 
      of its copies made in the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries.  
      2. Precisely because authenticity is not reproducible, the intensive 
      penetration of certain (mechanical) processes of reproduction was 
      instrumental in differentiating and grading authenticity. To develop such 
      differentiations was an important function of the trade in works of art. 
      The invention of the woodcut may be said to have struck at the root of the 
      quality of authenticity even before its late flowering. To be sure, at the 
      time of its origin a medieval picture of the Madonna could not yet be said 
      to be "authentic." It became "authentic" only during the succeeding 
      centuries and perhaps most strikingly so during the last one.  
      3. The poorest provincial staging of Faust is superior to a Faust film in 
      that, ideally, it competes with the first performance at Weimar. Before 
      the screen it is unprofitable to remember traditional contents which might 
      come to mind before the stage--for instance, that Goethe's friend Johann 
      Heinrich Merck is hidden in Mephisto, and the like.  
      4. To satisfy the human interest of the masses may mean to have one's 
      social function removed from the field of vision. Nothing guarantees that 
      a portraitist of today, when painting a famous surgeon at the breakfast 
      table in the midst of his family, depicts his social function more 
      precisely than a painter of the 17th century who portrayed his medical 
      doctors as representing this profession, like Rembrandt in his "Anatomy 
      Lesson."  
      5. The definition of the aura as a "unique phenomenon of a distance 
      however close it may be" represents nothing but the formulation of the 
      cult value of the work of art in categories of space and time perception. 
      Distance is the opposite of closeness. The essentially distant object is 
      the unapproachable one. Unapproachability is indeed a major quality of the 
      cult image. True to its nature, it remains "distant, however close it may 
      be." The closeness which one may gain from its subject matter does not 
      impair the distance which it retains in its appearance.  
      6. To the extent to which the cult value of the painting is secularized 
      the ideas of its fundamental uniqueness lose distinctness. In the 
      imagination of the beholder the uniqueness of the phenomena which hold 
      sway in the cult image is more and more displaced by the empirical 
      uniqueness of the creator or of his creative achievement. To be sure, 
      never completely so; the concept of authenticity always transcends mere 
      genuineness. (This is particularly apparent in the collector who always 
      retains some traces of the fetishist and who, by owning the work of art, 
      shares in its ritual power.) Nevertheless, the function of the concept of 
      authenticity remains determinate in the evaluation of art; with the 
      secularization of art, authenticity displaces the cult value of the work.  

      7. In the case of films, mechanical reproduction is not, as with 
      literature and painting, an external condition for mass distribution. 
      Mechanical reproduction is inherent in the very technique of film 
      production. This technique not only permits in the most direct way but 
      virtually causes mass distribution. It enforces distribution because the 
      production of a film is so expensive that an individual who, for instance, 
      might afford to buy a painting no longer can afford to buy a film. In 1927 
      it was calculated that a major film, in order to pay its way, had to reach 
      an audience of nine million. With the sound film, to be sure, a setback in 
      its international distribution occurred at first: audiences became limited 
      by language barriers. This coincided with the Fascist emphasis on national 
      interests. It is more important to focus on this connection with Fascism 
      than on this setback, which was soon minimized by synchronization. The 
      simultaneity of both phenomena is attributable to the depression. The same 
      disturbances which, on a larger scale, led to an attempt to maintain the 
      existing property structure by sheer force led the endangered film capital 
      to speed up the development of the sound film. The introduction of the 
      sound film brought about a temporary relief, not only because it again 
      brought the masses into the theaters but also because it merged new 
      capital from the electrical industry with that of the film industry. Thus, 
      viewed from the outside, the sound film promoted national interests, but 
      seen from the inside it helped to internationalize film production even 
      more than previously.  
      8. This polarity cannot come into its own in the aesthetics of Idealism. 
      Its idea of beauty comprises these polar opposites without dlfferentiating 
      between them and consequently excludes their polarity. Yet in Hegel this 
      polarity announces itself as clearly as possible within the limits of 
      Idealism. We quote from his *Philosophy of History*:  
      "Images were known of old. Piety at an early time required them for 
      worship, but it could do without beautiful images. These might even be 
      disturbing. In every beautiful painting there is also something 
      nonspiritual, merely external, but its spirit speaks to man through its 
      beauty. Worshipping, conversely, is concerned with the work as an object, 
      for it is but a spiritless stupor of the soul.... Fine art has arisen ... 
      in the church ..., although it has already gone beyond its principle as 
      art."  
      Likewise, the following passage from *The Philosophy of Fine Art indicates 
      that Hegel sensed a problem here. "We are beyond the stage of reverence 
      for works of art as divine and objects deserving our worship. The 
      impression they produce is one of a more reflective kind, and the emotions 
      they arouse require a higher test...."--G. W. F. Hegel, *The Philosophy of 
      Fine Art*, trans., with notes, by F. P. B. Osmaston, Vol. I, p. 12, 
      London, 192O.  
      The transition from the first kind of artistic reception to the second 
      characterizes the history of artistic reception in general. Apart from 
      that, a certain oscillation between these two polar modes of reception can 
      be demonstrated for each work of art. Take the Sistine Madonna. Since 
      Hubert Grimme's research it has been known that the Madonna originally was 
      painted for the purpose of exhibition. Grimme's research was inspired by 
      the question: What is the purpose of the molding in the foreground of the 
      painting which the two cupids lean upon? How, Grimme asked further, did 
      Raphael come to furnish the sky with two draperies? Research proved that 
      the Madonna had been commissioned for the public lying-in-state of Pope 
      Sixties. The Popes lay in state in a certain side chapel of St. Peter's. 
      On that occasion Rappel&Otilde;s picture had been fastened in a niche like 
      background of the chapel, supported by. the coffin. In this picture 
      Raphael portrays the Madonna approaching the papal coffin in clouds from 
      the background of the niche, which was demarcated by green drapes. At the 
      obsequies of Sixties a pre-eminent exhibition value of Raphael's picture 
      was taken advantage of. Some time later it was placed on the high altar in 
      the church of the Black Friars at Piacenza. The reason for this exile is 
      to be found in the Roman rites which forbid the use of paintings exhibited 
      at obsequies as cult objects on the high altar. This regulation devalued 
      Raphael's picture to some degree. In order to obtain an adequate price 
      nevertheless, the Papal See resolved to add to the bargain the tacit 
      toleration of the plcture above the high altar. To avoid attention the 
      picture was given to the monks of the far-off provincial town.  
      9. Bertolt Brecht, on a different level, engaged in analogous reflectlons: 
      "If the concept of 'work of art' can no longer be applied to the thing 
      that emerges once the work is transformed into a commodity, we have to 
      eliminate this concept with cautious care but without fear, lest we 
      liquidate the function of the very thing as well. For it has to go through 
      this phase without mental reservation, and not as noncommittal deviation 
      from the straight path; rather, what happens here with the work of art 
      will change it fundamentally and erase its past to such an extent that 
      should the old concept be taken up again--and it will, why not?--it will 
      no longer stir any memory of the thing it once designated."  
      l0. "The film . . . provides--or could provide--useful insight into the 
      details of human actions.... Character is never used as a source of 
      motivation; the inner life of the persons never supplies the principal 
      cause of the plot and seldom is its main result." (Bertolt Brecht, 
      *Versuche*, "Der Dreigroschenprozess," p. 268.) The expansion of the field 
      of the testable which mechanical equipment brings about for the actor 
      corresponds to the extraordinary expansion of the field of the testable 
      brought about for the individual through economic conditions. Thus, 
      vocational aptitude tests become constantly more important. What matters 
      in these tests are segmental performances of the individual. The film shot 
      and the vocational aptitude test are taken before a committee of experts. 
      The camera director in the studio occupies a place identical with that of 
      the examiner during aptitude tests.  
      11. Rudolf Arnheim, *Film als Kunst*, Berlin, 1932, pp. 176f. In this 
      context certain seemingly unimportant details in which the film director 
      deviates from stage practices gain in interest. Such is the attempt to let 
      the actor play without make-up, as made among others by Dreyer in his 
      Jeanne d'Arc. Dreyer spent months seeking the forty actors who constitute 
      the Inquisitors' tribunal. The search for these actors resembled that for 
      stage properties that are hard to come by. Dreyer made every effort to 
      avoid resemblances of age, build, and physiognomy. If the actor thus 
      becomes a stage property, this latter, on the other hand, frequently 
      functions as actor. At least it is not unusual for the film to assign a 
      role to the stage property. Instead of choosing at random from a great 
      wealth of examples, let us concentrate on a particularly convincing one. A 
      clock that is working will always be a disturbance on the stage. There it 
      cannot be permitted its function of measuring time. Even in a naturalistic 
      play, astronomical time would clash with theatrical time. Under these 
      circumstances it is highly revealing that the film can, whenever 
      appropriate, use time as measured by a clock. From this more than from 
      many other touches it may clearly be recognized that under certain 
      circumstances each and every prop in a film may assume important 
      functions. From here it is but one step to Pudovkin's statement that "the 
      playing of an actor which is connected with an object and is built around 
      it . . . is always one of the strongest methods of cinematic 
      construction." (W. Pudovkin, *Filmregie und Filmmanuskript*, Berlin, 1928, 
      p. 126.) The film is the first art form capable of demonstrating how 
      matter plays tricks on man. Hence, films can be an excellent means of 
      materialistic representation.  
      12. The change noted here in the method of exhibition caused by mechanical 
      reproduction applies to politics as well. The present crisis of the 
      bourgeois democracies comprises a crisis of the conditions which determine 
      the public presentation of the rulers. Democracies exhibit a member of 
      government directly and personally before the nation's representatives. 
      Parliament is his public. Since the innovations of camera and recording 
      equipment make it possible for the orator to become audible and visible to 
      an unlimited number of persons, the presentation of the man of politics 
      before camera and recording equipment becomes paramount. Parliaments, as 
      much as theaters, are deserted. Radio and film not only affect the 
      function of the professional actor but likewise the function of those who 
      also exhibit themselves before this mechanical equipment, those who 
      govern. Though their tasks may be different, the change affects equally 
      the actor and the ruler. The trend is toward establishing controllable and 
      transferrable skills under certain social conditions. This results in a 
      new selection, a selection before the equipment from which the star and 
      the dictator emerge victorious.  
      13. The privileged character of the respective techniques is lost. Aldous 
      Huxley writes: "Advances in technology have led ... to vulgarity.... 
      Process reproduction and the rotary press have made possible the 
      indefinite multiplication of writing and pictures. Universal education and 
      relatively high wages have created an enormous public who know how to read 
      and can afford to buy reading and pictorial matter. A great industry has 
      been called into existence in order to supply these commodities. Now, 
      artistic talent is a very rare phenomenon; whence it follows . . . that, 
      at every epoch and in all countries, most art has been bad. But the 
      proportion of trash in the total artistic output is greater now than at 
      any other period. That it must be so is a matter of simple arithmetic. The 
      population of Western Europe has a little more than doubled during the 
      last century. But the amount of reading--and seeing--matter has Increased, 
      I should imagine, at least twenty and possibly fifty or even a hundred 
      times. If there were n men of talent in a population of x millions, there 
      will presumably be 2n men of talent among 2X millions. The situation may 
      be summed up thus. For every page of print and pictures published a 
      century ago, twenty or perhaps even a hundred pages are published today. 
      But for every man of talent then living, there are now only two men of 
      talent. lt may be of course that, thanks to universal education, many 
      potential talents which in the past would have been stillborn are now 
      enabled to realize themselves. Let us assume, then, that there are now 
      three or even four men of talent to every one of earlier times. It still 
      remains true to say that the consumption of readlng--and seeing--matter 
      has far outstripped the natural productlon of gifted writers and 
      draughtsmen. lt is the same with hearing-matter. Prosperity, the 
      gramophone and the radio have created an audience of hearers who consume 
      an amount of hearing-matter that has increased out of all proportion to 
      the increase of population and the consequent natural increase of talented 
      musicians. lt follows from all this that in all the arts the output of 
      trash is both absolutely and relatively greater than it was in the past; 
      and that it must remain greater for just so long as the world continues to 
      consume the present inordinate quantities of reading-matter, 
      seeing-matter, and hearing-matter."--Aldous Huxley, *Beyond the Mexique 
      Bay. A Traveller's Journal*, London, 1949 pp. 274 ff. First published in 
      1934.  
      This mode of observation is obviously not progressive.  
      14. The boldness of the cameraman is indeed comparable to that of the 
      surgeon. Luc Durtain lists among specific technical sleights of hand those 
      "which are required in surgery in the case of certain difficult 
      operations. I choose as an example a case from oto-rhinolaryngology; . . . 
      the so- called endonasal perspective procedure; or I refer to the 
      acrobatic tricks of larynx surgery which have to be performed following 
      the reversed picture in the laryngoscope. I might also speak of ear 
      surgery which suggests the precision work of watchmakers. What range of 
      the most subtle muscular acrobatics is required from the man who wants to 
      repair or save the human body! We have only to think of the couching of a 
      cataract where there is virtually a debate of steel with nearly fluid 
      tissue, or of the major abdominal operations (laparotomy)."--Luc Durtain, 
      op. cit.  
      15. This mode of observation may seem crude, but as the great theoretician 
      Leonardo has shown, crude modes of observation may at times be usefully 
      adduced. Leonardo compares painting and music as follows: "Painting is 
      superior to music because, unlike unfortunate music, it does not have to 
      die as soon as it is born.... Music which is consumed in the very act of 
      its birth is inferior to painting which the use of varnish has rendered 
      eternal." (Trattato I, 29.)  
      16. Renaissance painting offers a revealing analogy to this situation. The 
      incomparable development of this art and its significance rested not least 
      on the integration of a number of new sciences, or at least of new 
      scientific data. Renaissance painting made use of anatomy and perspective, 
      of mathematics, meteorology, and chromatology. Valery writes: "What could 
      be further from us than the strange claim of a Leonardo to whom painting 
      was a supreme goal and the ultimate demonstration of knowledge? Leonardo 
      was convinced that painting demanded universal knowledge, and he did not 
      even shrink from a theoretical analysis which to us is stunning because of 
      its very depth and precision...."--Paul Valery, *Pieces sur l'Art*, 
      "Autour de Corot," Paris, p. 19l.  
      17. "The work of art," says Andre Breton, "is valuable only in so far as 
      it is vibrated by the reflexes of the future." Indeed, every developed art 
      form intersects three lines of development. Technology works toward a 
      certain form of art. Before the advent of the film there were photo 
      booklets with pictures which flitted by the onlooker upon pressure of the 
      thumb, thus portraying a boxing bout or a tennis match. Then there were 
      the slot machines in bazaars; their picture sequences were produced by the 
      turning of a crank.  
      Secondly, the traditional art forms in certain phases of their development 
      strenuously work toward effects which later are effortlessly attained by 
      the new ones. Before the rise of the movie the Dadaists' performances 
      tried to create an audience reaction which Chaplin later evoked in a more 
      natural way.  
      Thirdly, unspectacular social changes often promote a change in 
      receptivity which will benefit the new art form. Before the movie had 
      begun to create its public, pictures that were no longer immobile 
      captivated an assembled audience in the so-called *Kaiserpanorama*. Here 
      the public assembled before a screen into which stereoscopes were mounted, 
      one to each beholder. By a mechanical process individual pictures appeared 
      briefly before the stereoscopes, then made way for others. Edison still 
      had to use similar devices in presenting the first movie strip before the 
      film screen and projection were known. This strip was presented to a small 
      public which stared into the apparatus in which the succession of pictures 
      was reeling off. Incidentally, the institution of the *Kaiserpanorama* 
      shows very clearly a dialectic of the development. Shortly before the 
      movie turned the reception of pictures into a collective one, the 
      individual viewing of pictures in these swiftly outmoded establishments 
      came into play once more with an intensity comparable to that of the 
      ancient priest beholding the statue of a divinity in the cella.  
      18. The theological archetype of this contemplation is the awareness of 
      being alone with one's God. Such awareness, in the heyday of the 
      bourgeoisie, went to strengthen the freedom to shake off clerical 
      tutelage. During the decline of the bourgeoisie this awareness had to take 
      into account the hidden tendency to withdraw from public affairs those 
      forces which the individual draws upon in his communion with God.  
      19. The film is the art form that is in keeping with the increased threat 
      to his life which modern man has to face. Man's need to expose himself to 
      shock effects is his adjustment to the dangers threatening him. The film 
      corresponds to profound changes in the apperceptive apparatus--changes 
      that are experienced on an individual scale by the man in the street in 
      big-city traffic, on a historical scale by every present-day citizen.  
      20. As for Dadaism, insights important for Cubism and Futurism are to be 
      gained from the movie. Both appear as deficient attempts of art to 
      accommodate the pervasion of reality by the apparatus. ln contrast to the 
      film, these schools did not try to use the apparatus as such for the 
      artistic presentation of reality, but aimed at some sort of alloy in the 
      joint presentation of reality and apparatus. In Cubism, the premonition 
      that this apparatus will be structurally based on optics plays a dominant 
      part; in Futurism, it is the premonition of the effects of this apparatus 
      which are brought out by the rapid sequence of the film strip.  
      21. One technical feature is significant here, especially with regard to 
      newsreels, the propagandist importance of which can hardly be 
      overestimated. Mass reproduction is aided especially by the reproduction 
      of masses. In big parades and monster rallies, in sports events, and in 
      war, all of which nowadays are captured by camera and sound recording, the 
      masses are brought face to face with themselves. Thls process, whose 
      significance need not be stressed, is intimately connected with the 
      development of the techniques of reproductlon and photography. Mass 
      movements are usually discerned more clearly by a camera than by the naked 
      eye. A bird's-eye view best captures gatherings of hundreds of thousands. 
      And even though such a view may be as accessible to the human eye as it is 
      to the camera, the image received by the eye cannot be enlarged the way a
