Introduction
This essay is an attempt to clarify the ongoing public debates over Creation 
Science, disputes frequently (or even characteristically) notable for the 
logical confusion, arguing at cross purposes, and generally shoddy thinking 
(often laced with vitriol) which they seem to encourage from participants in all 
camps. Much of this confusion undoubtedly stems from deliberate obfuscation, 
rhetorical skullduggery, and chop logic which partisans of all views use to 
advance their opinions over issues in which a great deal more than the immediate 
claims are involved. But much of the confusion emerges also from the endemic 
imprecision in the terminology and a genuine failure to understand some basic 
principles of reasonable argument, especially scientific argument.
The central debate itself is frequently misrepresented as a conflict about 
whether Darwin's account of evolution or the Biblical account of creation is 
true&#8212;a question which is impossible to answer once and for all, depending, as it 
does, on the criteria we establish for recognizing truth. In fact, however, the 
usual forum in which the argument takes place concerns itself with a much more 
specific question with immediate social consequences: Should Creation Science be 
taught in the science classes of our schools as a regular part of the science 
curriculum (given, as it were, equal time with Darwinian theories)?
This essay focuses upon the latter question and proposes the following answer: 
No, Creationism or Creation Science should not be taught in the science 
curriculum, not because it isn't true but because it isn't science. This answer, 
one should note, leaves open the question of whether or not the Biblical account 
of creation should be taught elsewhere in the school curriculum.
In the process of outlining an argument for the above answer, this paper hopes 
to establish, as I say, some clarity, so that those who do not agree with the 
conclusions will at least take away from the paper a clearer understanding of 
the problem and of some of the ways in which debates on this issue are routinely 
sabotaged.
Some Terminology
The first essential step in framing any contribution to the debate (or in 
understanding other people's positions) is to understand clearly what they mean 
by the key terms (imprecision is often rampant here). So, by way of clarifying 
the rest of this essay, let me define as explicitly as I can what I mean by the 
words fundamental to the arguments.
Evolution in its root biological sense means simply the development of forms of 
animal and plant life out of forms significantly different from them (e.g., 
birds from reptiles, human beings from higher apes). It makes no claims about 
how this process occurs. This simple definition refers only to the event 
(however it occurs). Hence (as I shall point out) one can be an evolutionist 
(i.e., believe in evolution) without being a Darwinian (history provides many 
examples of such people). To understand what follows in this paper, readers 
should not immediately conflate the two terms evolution and Darwinism (as is 
routinely done, especially by scientists): the two terms define separate things.
The doctrine opposite to evolution is called Fixity of Species. It maintains 
that species (animal and plant types) are fixed, stable, and permanent. There 
may be some variation from one individual to another within the same species (an 
obvious fact), and some species are clearly quite similar to others (e.g., dogs 
and wolves). But under this doctrine, species arise independently of one 
another. Again, this doctrine carries with it no single explanation of how these 
species arose&#8212;except that they arose independently of each other and have not 
changed.
In between these two there are a number of intermediate positions, what I call 
Limited Evolution, the claim that some species arise out of species closely 
related to them, but that such a form of speciation is limited. So, for example, 
different species of fish may have developed by evolution out of one or more 
common fish ancestors. However, Limited Evolution would deny the possibility of 
evolution from one major group to another (e.g., from fish to birds).
Creationism, as used in this essay (and generally), refers to the belief that 
the development of species, the variety of plants and animals, occurred as 
described in the Book of Genesis, as a special creation by God. Hence, 
Creationism holds to the doctrine of Fixity of Species (no evolution) and 
accounts for the variety of life by invoking separate divine acts of creation. 
Those Creationists who hold to the literal truth of the Genesis account 
(especially to the order and time of the stages of creation) are often called 
Fundamentalists. Various other Creationists maintain the truth of the Genesis 
account but read that account allegorically (e.g., each day in the Genesis 
account is not really a day but a stage of creation lasting a very long time). 
Creation Science (a term frequently used interchangeably with Creationism) 
refers to a faith in Creationism, together with a claim that this belief has 
scientific status and hence should be seen as a scientific alternative to modern 
evolutionary theories. Thus, it is possible to be a Creationist (i.e., believe 
in the Genesis account) without being a Creation Scientist (i.e., without 
claiming scientific status for that account).
The term Darwinism (again, as used in this essay) refers to a theory developed 
by Charles Darwin and much modified by modern biologists which endorses 
evolution and which provides an account of how evolution occurs (through Natural 
Selection and other mechanisms). The key element of Darwinism that separates it 
from other evolutionary theories is this: Darwinian theory maintains that at the 
heart of the mechanism of evolution lies a random mechanical process, without 
any intelligent sense of purpose (more about that later).  These random 
variations in animals and plants will sometimes provide the individual plant or 
animal an advantage which will enable it to complete better than other members 
of its species.  Over time such cumulative advantageous variations will bring 
about significant changes which will lead to the creation of a new species out 
of the old one.
Finally, a crucial term in this debate is the word science. Without going into a 
long discussion of this complex issue, while at the same time acknowledging that 
a precise definition of science is a contentious question, let me propose that 
science is a way of explaining natural phenomena with physical models and 
theories which generate predictions which can be tested publicly and repeatedly 
by observation (please note here the emphasis on observing the results of the 
predictions, not on observing the actual process upon which the prediction is 
based). Such models and theories must be physical (e.g., matter in motion, 
forces, collisions, physical reactions) and rational (preferably mathematical). 
As soon as one appeals to non-natural forces, magic, metaphysical factors, some 
inexplicable change in the regular working of the laws of physics, divine 
intervention, and so on, one is ceasing to be a scientist.
The Strong Case for Evolution
On the basis of the above definitions, it is possible to make a very strong case 
for the scientific validity of evolution. Consider the following facts, all of 
which have been confirmed overwhelmingly by the established processes of 
science:
  1. There is enormous variety in the plant and animal kingdoms. Some species of 
  plants and animals have much more complex organic structures than other 
  species.
  2. All living things must come from at least one living parent (i.e., life 
  does not arise spontaneously out of non-life).
  3. The simplest forms of plant and animal life were on earth long before the 
  more complex forms (as confirmed by the geological succession of fossils).
If (please note this word) the above statements are scientifically valid, then 
there is no reasonable conclusion one can reach other than the obvious one: the 
complex forms of life must have somehow arisen from the less complex forms of 
life. In other words, the complex animals evolved out of the less complex 
animals (which are no longer very much like them). To refuse to accept this 
conclusion is unreasonable and unscientific. One is at liberty to refuse to 
accept the conclusion, of course, but not to claim that that is a rational 
scientific procedure.
Of course, if one of the above claims is wrong, then this strong case for 
evolution collapses immediately. So the challenge to those who would dismiss the 
validity of evolution (as defined in this essay) as a scientific theory is 
clear: Which of those three claims is false? The first one is self-evidently 
true. The second has never been falsified (except in fiction like Frankenstein). 
And the third has been repeatedly confirmed every time anyone observes the 
succession of fossils in the geological record (e.g., the layers of the Grand 
Canyon or any other fossilized strata available for inspection).
It makes no difference to this case to raise some question about the origin of 
life (the First Cause argument which indicates that if we trace the chain of 
mechanical causes back in time we logically require a non-mechanical starting 
point, something beyond scientific explanation). That sort of explanation for 
the origin of the process lies outside of science (which is why scientists are 
not interested in it) and, in any case, it has nothing to do with the continuing 
development of life once established on earth.
One popular answer to the case for evolution sketched out above proposed by 
anti-evolutionists is the argument that geological features like the Grand 
Canyon were created by divine intervention in a matter of days, so that we have 
no right to infer that the fossils in the higher layers were not also created at 
the same time as those in the lower layers. That, of course, may be true, but 
such a claim, which appeals to miraculous metaphysical intervention or some 
unspecified physical process (in violation of the known laws of physics) rather 
than to known physical processes, is not scientific.
Dealing with the strong case for evolution with an appeal to Limited Evolution 
(as defined above) runs into the same difficulties.  To concede evolution within 
major groups, like, say, fish, may account for material evidence in the fossil 
record.  But to deny evolution from one group to the next (say, from fish to 
reptiles) leaves open the question: Where then did the reptiles come from?  To 
affirm that they were specially created by God after the fish is, once again, an 
appeal to non-scientific reasons which generate no predictions.
The Anti-Evolutionist's Most Common Response
In practice, and for understandable reasons, those hostile to evolution rarely 
tackle the above case directly (by seeking to disprove one of the three claims 
upon which it rests). Instead they focus almost all their energies into pointing 
out potential and real difficulties in Darwinian theory. Anyone who consults the 
many Internet pages devoted to advancing Creation Science will quickly enough 
realize that the major thrust of almost every article is not an attempt to 
establish the scientific truth of Genesis or to challenge the strong case for 
evolution (made above), but to direct our attention to limitations in Darwinian 
theory.
Now, many of these limitations may be substantial, but calling attention to them 
in this way does little to advance the cause of Creationism (except among those 
who are already persuaded or who do not attend to the logical deficiencies of 
the basic argument). Let me outline why such attacks (though often rhetorically 
effective) are logically unpersuasive.
Firstly, any perceived deficiency in Darwinian theory does no harm whatsoever to 
the case for evolution outlined above. That case would be equally strong if no 
one had ever heard of Darwinian theory (which is an attempt, not to prove the 
validity of evolutionary theory, but to account for how evolution proceeds). 
Even if there were absolutely compelling evidence that Darwinian theory was 
totally wrong about the mechanisms of the evolutionary process, the case for 
evolution would remain as strong as ever. If one wants to discredit the very 
concept of evolution, then calling particular issues in Darwinian theory to 
account is a gigantic red herring.
Secondly, discrediting Darwinian theory as an explanation for the evolutionary 
process provides no special support for any other rival theory of species, 
certainly not for Creationism. The idea that it does is a clear case of a basic 
logical flaw called False Dilemma. And this logical flaw is the most frequent 
rhetorical ploy used by Creation Scientists to advance their theories. Their 
case goes something like this:
  1. There are only two possible explanations for the development of species, 
  the Genesis account and the Darwinian account.
  2. But there are many, many difficulties with the Darwinian account.
  3. Therefore the Genesis account must be correct (or preferable or equally 
  deserving of attention in our schools).
The flaw here is obvious. The first claim is manifestly false, since there are 
literally hundreds of narrative accounts of how species came to be formed. 
Virtually every culture has developed its own, and within science itself there 
have been competing theories.  Discarding or discrediting any particular one 
does not especially privilege any of the others (just as, if we have twenty 
equally good suspects in a murder case, proving that one of them could not have 
done the crime doesn't enable us to state conclusively that a particular one of 
the remaining nineteen did).
The Nature of Scientific Claims and Disagreements About Those Claims
In addition to the logical problems mentioned above, a good deal of Creation 
Science's case against Darwinian theory exploits (sometimes very skillfully) a 
general ignorance about the nature of scientific enquiry. In the process, those 
attacking Darwin not only reveal their failure (deliberate or otherwise) to 
understand what science is (or how science is carried out) but also unwittingly 
invoke principles which would sink their own preferred theory in a minute.
For instance, the case is often made that since evolution cannot be observed in 
action, it is therefore not a valid scientific theory, for all scientific 
theories (so it is alleged) have to be confirmed by direct observation of the 
process under investigation. Of course, this is not the case. Many scientific 
hypothetical models simply cannot be observed directly (e.g., molecular 
interactions, expansion at the edge of the universe, and so on). The essence of 
many scientific procedures is making predictions based on a hypothetical model 
of a physical phenomenon (without having direct observational evidence of the 
reality which that model is designed to explain) and then testing the 
prediction. What characterizes such a process as scientific is that the 
prediction can be repeatedly and publicly checked by anyone in some quantifiable 
manner. Most of the work of science consists of carrying out such tests of 
predictions and then confirming aspects of the theoretical model or discovering 
errors, anomalies, inconsistencies, and so on.
By that procedure, evolution is clearly scientific, since every detailed study 
of fossilized strata is, in effect, a test of the theory. If someone were to 
locate a complex life form in the very oldest rock levels, evolutionary theory 
would be in difficulty, since such a finding would flatly contradict its 
predictions. The fact that such an observation has never occurred provides some 
of the best evidence for the validity of the theory.
One of the gravest scientific objections to the Creation Scientist's account of 
the creation of species is precisely this point. Not only can the story of how 
God created the world and everything in it never be observed (in that respect it 
is even more deficient than the theory of evolution), but the Genesis narrative 
generates virtually no testable predictions, other than one which has been so 
repeatedly falsified that it has no scientific validity whatsoever (namely, that 
if all the species were formed at the same time, we should find all types at all 
levels of the fossilized strata).
In the same way, pointing out difficulties with Darwinian theory does not 
automatically discredit the theory. Scientists themselves argue all the time 
about details of the theory&#8212;there are rival interpretations for all sorts of 
things within it (like the rate of change, the importance of natural selection 
in comparison with other agents of change, like genetic drift, the lack of 
intermediate types, the lengths of time involved, and so on).
Creation Scientists who spend so much time pointing out problems with Darwinian 
theory sometimes seem to assume that if a scientific theory cannot explain 
everything to everyone's satisfaction, if some of the predictions of the theory 
are questionable, if anomalies exist, then the total theory must be incorrect. 
But that is not how science proceeds. Scientific theories of any interest always 
contain problems which scientists argue about. They may accept the basic 
assumptions of the theory but disagree about many of the details and discuss 
essential adjustments to the basic model. Nowhere is that more true today than 
among biologists&#8212;almost all of whom accept Darwinian theory as the basic 
explanatory framework but who have often very fierce disputes about particular 
details and problems within that framework.
In fact, once a theory ceases to generate these sorts of arguments, once all the 
details get worked out to everyone's satisfaction, then scientists tend to lose 
interest in the theory (for it presents no interesting problems to investigate). 
That area of scientific enquiry is then handed over in its entirety to the 
technicians, and the scientists move on to more problematic areas.
In addition, even if there are natural phenomena which a theory cannot explain 
fully or which apparently contradict what that theory predicts, often the theory 
will be retained for its explanatory value in other areas. Newton's theories do 
not hold, for example, at the level of atomic particles. But that does not mean 
we discard his theories in those areas where they are still valid. When we send 
men and women out into space, we still use Newton's equations.
It may be worth remembering that in Darwin's own day there were three major 
scientific objections to his theory.  The first was the lack of transitional 
types, fossils intermediate between species.  The second was Darwin's theory of 
inheritance (the concept of "blending" of material from the two parents made 
Darwin's theory mathematically impossible).  And the third was the estimated age 
of the earth (according to the most eminent physicists the decreasing heat of 
the earth indicated that it could not possibly be old enough for Darwin's theory 
to be correct).  The second two objections were taken care of by future 
discoveries (Mendelian genetics and radioactivity), and the first objection has 
been partially dealt with by the discovery of thousands of transitional types 
(even if the number is not enough to satisfy everyone).  Those who like to argue 
that Darwin's theory is scientifically impossible might like to consider the 
history of these first serious objections.
The point is that no one can deny that Darwinian theory generates problems, has 
difficulty answering many objections, and cannot account for certain 
observations (at least not yet). To point these things out is a valuable 
reminder of some important scientific questions still urgently requiring answers 
and might well be a useful challenge to some science teachers to curb their 
frequently reductive confidence. The greatest contribution Creation scientists 
make to the ongoing arguments is to call attention repeatedly to these problems 
and to give a jolt to the complacent assumptions of many science teachers. 
However, such issues do not necessarily disqualify the theory&#8212;and they certainly 
add nothing to make Creationism more credible as a scientific theory.
Allegorizing Genesis
Some Creationists concede that Genesis is not a literal account of the creation 
of species but an allegorical depiction of the stages through which life 
appeared on earth under the creative hand of God. The sequence, so the claim 
goes, corresponds with the fossil evidence. We simply have to read the days of 
Genesis as much more extensive time periods. There is no evolution of one 
species into another. God simply created all the species at different times.
Such an argumentative move naturally destroys the fundamentalists' position 
(that Genesis is a literal account) and permits us to see the succession of 
animal and plant types as a gradual matter over many millions of years (as the 
scientific evidence suggests), rather than as one creative act. But the tactic 
does nothing to improve the scientific status of creationism, since it still 
requires an appeal to non-physical divine interventions as an explanatory cause 
and does nothing to encourage the formation of precisely testable predictions.
Adjusting a theoretical framework to account for the facts is a standard 
practice in science, but a theory is not infinitely adjustable. If the Genesis 
account can be allegorized and re-allegorized to fit whatever science turns up 
(by appealing to the miraculous powers of God), then the theory is 
scientifically empty, because inventive allegory can account for anything (a 
standard criticism of Marxist and Freudian theories as unscientific).
Allegorizing Genesis provides no help in arriving a material, physical (i.e., 
scientific) explanation for new discoveries (a standard requirement for any 
scientific theory). If some new species is discovered, all Genesis has to offer 
by way of an explanation is that God created it in that place at that time for 
His own purposes. From a scientific point of view, such an explanation is empty 
of significant content (i.e., it offers nothing by way of a scientific 
explanation and generates no predictions to test). Evolution, by contrast, 
encourages us to trace (or construct) a narrative history of material change 
which links this new species with other known species, thus providing a material 
explanation for its existence, which becomes the basis for certain predictions 
which we can test with our observations.
The Argument from Intelligent Design
One of the oldest, most persistent, and most interesting arguments raised by 
Creation Scientists against Darwinian theory is the so-called Design Argument 
or, to use its modern name, the Argument from Intelligent Design. Simply put, 
this claim states that the enormous complexity of some organs (the human eye is 
a favorite example) simply could not have arisen as the result of a large number 
of small random changes, each one selected for its survival advantage (What 
would be the use, for example, of one percent of the eye?). Allied to this 
objection is the potentially damaging claim that expecting small random 
mutations to produce something as complex as an eye by chance, even given a long 
length of time, is statistically impossible (rather like expecting monkeys 
trained to hit typewriter keys to produce a speech from Shakespeare).
The existence of very complex organs like the eye and the fact that many organic 
structures are a complex interlocking of different systems of nerves, bones, 
muscles, blood vessels, and so on (in which a significant random change in any 
one element would affect the entire organism for the worse) have led people 
(including many biologists) to infer the existence of a divine designer, a 
supreme intelligence, God, who created such marvelous organs. How else are we to 
account for such astonishingly complicated design of such a well-functioning 
organ? And from the effective functioning of such organs one might further infer 
(and many thinkers have inferred) the benevolence of God, who designs such 
structures for the assistance of His created beings.
The Design Argument is a very important concept both in the History of Science 
and in the present arguments because it enables the person who invokes it to 
link scientific fact (like the structure of the eye) with divine presence (God 
as the supreme designer). In fact, this argument was for a long time one of the 
most persuasive ways devoutly religious men, like Robert Boyle or Isaac Newton, 
urged that the study of science was a great service to religion. At the level of 
common sense, too, the Argument from Intelligent Design sounds plausible, 
especially if we undertake to understand the full complexity of an organic 
system in an animal. It is hard to accept that that could have been produced by 
a series of random changes, no matter how much time is involved.
The Design Argument, however, is not logically compelling simply because (as 
Immanuel Kant pointed out over two hundred years ago), one cannot conclude 
anything firm about non-physical beings (like God) on the basis of physical 
evidence. This would be (to use a trivial modern example) rather like making 
firm conclusions about a stranger's character on the basis of the numbers in his 
credit card. Even if we have trouble accepting the fact that random changes 
could produce something like the human eye, the complexity of that structure is 
not a sufficient reason for making conclusions about metaphysical things.
That said, one has to concede that many scientific activities routinely lead 
some people to  religious or spiritual insight. It's probably no accident that 
many great modern physicists have had profoundly mystical or religious 
sensibilities and have seen in the wonderfully eloquent and complex designs 
revealed by their scientific investigations encouragements for a leap of faith. 
But such mystical experience requires that leap of faith&#8212;it does not arise 
logically and compellingly out of the scientific design, nor is its validity 
logically confirmed by the existence of such design.
Theistic Evolution
Of course, the basic principles of the Argument from Intelligent Design do not 
specially privilege the Genesis account of the creation of species. For the 
Design Argument can easily be reconciled with evolution. All we have to do is 
see God as the force guiding evolution according to His purposes (which He may 
or may not have made known to us). In that sense, evolution is quite compatible 
with Theism&#8212;a faith in God. One might even go to the extent of arguing that the 
randomness in Darwinism&#8212;the perceived lack of any intelligent design&#8212;is simply 
apparent, a function of our human inability to know God's purposes (or a 
convenient model we adopt for its explanatory value).
However, at that point one is no longer being a scientist, since the moment one 
moves from the world of physical models, predictions, observable testing, and so 
on, into the realm of God's purposes one is moving outside of science, which 
explicitly confines itself to a way of understanding the physical realm in terms 
of physical processes and which, therefore, by definition, has nothing to reveal 
to us about God.
Reconciling Science and Religion
The above paragraphs have been stressing the key point in this paper: a faith in 
God is based upon a belief in non-physical or metaphysical powers; whereas, 
science limits itself to explanations of physical events in terms of natural 
physical processes. Hence, it would seem, the two forms of understanding the 
world and our place in it are fundamentally incompatible.
Does this mean that there is no way we can reconcile science and religion or 
Darwinian biology with Creationism? The short answer is no and yes. No, because, 
as mentioned above, the two forms of explanation are radically different in what 
counts as a valid reason. Yes, because there are different ways in which we 
might arrive at a shared understanding of both science and religion as 
complementary forms of knowledge.
For example, it is possible to adopt the view that the privileged explanation 
is, indeed, the account in Genesis, that that account is, as it were, the truth 
and, at the same time, to accept science as a useful or interesting thought 
experiment, something that provides a different account which we pursue, not 
because it is true, but because it serves some human purpose (satisfying our 
imaginations, helping us to deal with certain problems in life).
Here the analogy of a game might help. Obviously I can be a devout 
Fundamentalist and a soccer player. When I play soccer, certain rules define my 
activities, tell me what I can and cannot do, and evaluate my success (the rule 
book is my authority for how to proceed). And I can use this game in all sorts 
of ways&#8212;for exercise, recreation, or (if I am very good) profit. But at no time 
do I mistake soccer for the truth: it is a game I play for various reasons. If 
the game demands that I do something which violates my faith (e.g., play on 
Sunday), then I know where my priority lies. This stance towards science is 
logically consistent and, indeed, quite common among prominent scientists who 
were also devout Christians like Copernicus (who was Catholic monk), Descartes, 
and countless others--who presented their materialistic hypotheses as 
interesting and useful thought experiments, not as the truth of things.
By an extension of the same form of thinking, I could accept the randomness at 
the heart of Darwinian theory (the source of so much difficulty for anyone who 
wants life driven and shaped by a sense of creative purpose) as either an 
interesting hypothesis or as a temporary appearance, something which does not 
correspond with the truth of things, but which is something the human mind in 
its limited condition must accept in order to construct a useful historical 
understanding of nature.
Alternatively, of course, someone who wishes to reconcile Darwinian science and 
religious belief might want to subsume the religious belief under Darwinian 
theory and explain it away as a survival mechanism. Since a religious faith (one 
could argue) is a great asset in the struggle for life (giving hope in hard 
times, enabling a person to survive where another might fail), then the refusal 
to accept the atheistic implications of Darwinian theory is perfectly 
understandable in terms of that theory (especially if we accept that something 
like a predisposition to religious belief is a heritable trait). There is thus a 
plausible Darwinian explanation for the widespread refusal to accept Darwinian 
theory. While such a stance would hardly (one would think) encourage the 
scientist to a religious frame of mind, it might well make him more tolerant of 
religious belief and less inclined to the sort of frustrated irritation and 
ridicule which hard-core Darwinists sometimes manifest in the face of 
Creationism.
In either case, however, the separation between religion and science is clear. 
We can give one precedence over the other, or we can see them as two separate 
aspects of the way we know the world, but we cannot identify them as comparable 
activities, because as ways of knowing they focus on different areas of 
experience and proceed by different rules. To assert this is not to declare one 
method superior to the other as a way of understanding our experience or to 
assess one or the other as closer to the truth of things (whatever that means 
exactly).
But it is to assert that the two activities do not belong together under the 
same descriptive label unique to one of them, any more that we can assert that 
two different games, say, soccer and tennis, can both be adequately described 
either as soccer or tennis. Soccer has rules; to be a soccer player is to follow 
those rules. Ditto for tennis. Someone who demands the right to bring a tennis 
racquet onto the soccer pitch and to hit a tennis ball into the soccer goal in 
order to score would be missing the point of the game&#8212;just as someone who 
demands the right in a tennis match to kick or head the ball over the net would 
be missing the point of the tennis game. The demand of Creation Scientists to 
teach Genesis in science classes is no different. Why should something which is 
not science be taught in a science class?
Some Final Thoughts
None of the above argument seeks to establish any relative evaluation of the 
truth or the value of the Creationist account or the Darwinian account of the 
origin of species, nor about the importance of having the Genesis account of 
creation included in or barred from the school curriculum. From the start, as I 
explained in the Introduction, the point has been to insist that Creationism 
does not belong in the science curriculum (any more than German strong verbs 
belong in French class).
I can think of all sorts of reasons why it might be really important for school 
students to have a more than passing acquaintance with the Book of Genesis and 
with some of the more obvious points of argument within Darwinian theory. But 
the former belongs in some non-scientific class (Comparative Religion, Great 
Books), not as an essential part of the treatment of the latter in science 
class. And the latter can be taken care of (and should be taken care of) within 
the context of the scientific debates about Darwinism.
If the aim of Creationists is to encourage a wider and closer familiarity with 
the Biblical accounts of creation in our schools, one wonders why they keep 
tilting at the windmill of the science curriculum. Why try to sell the Genesis 
account as science when it so obviously is not&#8212;when it is valuable precisely 
because it is not science? Why not try to persuade people by focusing on what 
the Genesis account really is: a fascinating and enormously important cultural 
story, which for many stands at the centre of their religious understanding of 
the world?
Perhaps the answer to these questions has something to do with the fact that our 
public school system bars the teaching of religious doctrines, so that if 
Genesis is to get into the curriculum anywhere it will have to be disguised and 
smuggled into the science curriculum. But that tactic will never work, so long 
as we insist (reasonably enough) that the science curriculum should concern 
itself with science and nothing else.
