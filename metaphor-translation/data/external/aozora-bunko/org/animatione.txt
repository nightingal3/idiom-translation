Abstract
The medium of Japanese animation is a powerhouse in the world of alternative entertainment.
Proselytization by fans ignited the anime movement in America, despite Japanese copyright
holdersÅf abandonment of the American market. We present an historical and legal analysis to
demonstrate that, at least in one case spanning two decades, fansÅf continual infringement of
copyright spurred the progress of commerce and the arts.

Japanese anime titles are referenced in the text according to their prevailing English-language

Uch? Senkan Yamato, âFíàêÌäÕÉÑÉ}Ég, or Star Blazers; however, the text uses Star Blazers when
it specifically discusses that adaptation. If significant discrepancies exist between the original
Japanese, common English, and American commercial titles, an endnote at the first instance of
the title will furnish all of the Japanese and English titles.

1. Introduction 9/12/2004
Version 1.11-columnar Progress Against the Law Page 4 of 39
1. Introduction
Interest in, and consumption of, Japanese
animation has increased exponentially across the
world in the last ten years. Total sales of anime and
related character goods rose to \9 trillion (US$80
billion) in 2002, up from less than a tenth of that a
decade earlier.3 Despite JapanÅfs flagging revenues in
other markets from steel to manufacturing and heavy
industry, the Wall Street Journal recently commented
that ÅgJapan has more than made up for it because of
its cultural exports.Åh4 Indeed, Prime Minister
Junichiro Koizumi lauded anime in his 2003 opening
speech to the Diet. Using Spirited Away as a pointed
example, Koizumi asserted that anime has become
Ågthe savior or Japanese culture.Åh5 Considering all of
this Åghype,Åh we ask the question: how did anime, once
regarded as a product produced for and consumed by
Japanese children, become such a powerhouse in the
global media market?
The answer lies in the international pull, not
push, of anime to other nationsÅf shores. A wave of
internationals became interested in anime, manga
(Japanese comics), and other cultural products as they
studied or served in the military in Japan in the 1960s
and 1970s, at the very moment that the slogan ÅgJapan
as No. 1Åh began to reshape that countryÅfs popular
consciousness. Those who returned to America
wanted to share anime and manga with their friends.
The introduction of the VCR into the American and
Japanese mass markets in 1975 made this possible: for
the first time, fans could tape shows to show others in
America.6 Initially unable to share because of the
Japanese-English language barrier, fans were relegated
to explaining the bare basics of an anime plot as a
slew of fantastic imagery and incomprehensible
language bombarded audiences at the back of sciencefiction
conventions. Worse yet, a reader might
struggle with the Ågbackwards text and imagesÅh of
manga alongside a Japanese-competent friend. As
Henry Jenkins once commented about this period,
ÅgWe didnÅft know what the hell they were saying, but it
looked really cool.Åh7
New technology and distribution networks
quickly enabled fans to proliferate their anime
message. What followed was the birth of fan
distribution?a process of releasing anime shows on a
vast underground network of fans throughout the
country. Following a shift in the constitution of the
fandom, fansubbing, or translation and subtitling of
anime videos, was added to the distribution process
by 1990. After leaving college, many fans started
anime companies, becoming the industry leaders of
today.
Anime fan distribution networks?networks of
Japanese animation fans who imported and
distributed videos over a vast underground network
in the United States from the 1970s through the early
1990s?represented proselytization commons, or
spaces where media and ideas could be freely
exchanged to advance a directed cause. Upon these
networks many built their fortunes, and many more
spread the knowledge and enthusiasm of Japanese
animation to their American counterparts, all years
before the widespread adoption of the Internet. This
dissemination flouts theories of globalization as
directed by American cultural imperialism, for
Americans ÅgpulledÅh Japanese cultural products to
America en masse without coercion by Japanese
industry. Translation, reconstitution, and
reproduction were not antagonistic to profit-making
in early anime history; indeed, this fan process acted
as a prerequisite good/service combination to
widespread commercial exploitation. Fans,
distributors, and producers alike further belied that
these fan processes were necessary. Quite against the
restrictions of copyright, fan distribution of anime
flourished throughout the 1970s through 1990s to
catalyze a nascent domestic industry and to impel the
progress of the arts.
The remainder of the paper is organized as
follows. In the second section, we provide a primer for
readers who are unfamiliar with the terms Åganime,Åh
Ågmanga,Åh Ågfan distribution,Åh and Ågfansub,Åh terms that
this analysis will use heavily. In the third section, we
detail the history of the anime fan phenomenon as it
relates to the development of anime interest in the
United States, unpacking the processes and
motivations of key players in the movement between
1976 and 1993. We construct an historical argument
based on original interviews and primary sources,
ultimately determining that fan distribution
functioned economically as a prerequisite good to
licensed materials. In the fourth section, we present a
legal analysis of fan distribution and fan activities,
drawing from Japanese copyright law, American
copyright law, and relevant copyright implementation
treaties in effect during the period under examination.
We determine that fan distributors were left with no
recourse to committing copyright infringement in 2.1. Anime 9/12/2004
Version 1.11-columnar Progress Against the Law Page 5 of 39
order to satisfy their goals. In the final section, we
combine these analyses to assert that a sphere of
economic activity was created that existing copyright
regimes would have denied, directly contributing to
the rapid explosion in anime consumption and profit
for all parties involved.
2. Anime and Its Fandom: A
Primer for Non-Fans
2.1. Anime
ÅgAnimeÅh is the French abbreviation for
animation, a word that the Japanese adopted to
describe all animation. In America, ÅganimeÅh
specifically refers to the Japanese product, and is used
for both the singular and the plural. The first Japanese
animated film was a 5-minute short film called
Mukuzo Imokawa the Doorman (Mukuzo Imokawa
Genkanban no Maki) produced by Oten Shimokawa
in 1917.8 Various anime were produced throughout
the prewar and wartime periods, but animation
remained a curious oddity until 1958, when
animation studio Toei Doga released Hakujaden (The
Great White Snake),9 the first full-length, color anime
film. Most historians cite 1963 as the birth of the
anime industry, when famed manga artist and
animator Osamu Tezuka released Tetsuwan Atomu
(Astro Boy in the US),10 solidifying the long-standing
connection between anime and manga and
inculcating millions of Japanese youth with the love
of a super-robot who looked and acted just like a real
boy.
Anime is created for three distinct venues in
Japan: television, theatrical release, and direct-tovideo
(OVA, or Original Video Animation). OVAs
evolved from Mamoru OshiiÅfs 1983 Dallos, and from
the mid 80s to the mid 90s became the dominant
venue for experimental or avant-garde animation.
Variety in anime is both abundant and scarce: today,
there are over eighty anime productions airing on TV
every week. This figure does not include theatrical
and OVA offerings, which would bring the number
closer to 130. However, some animators, such as
Hayao Miyazaki, complain that the rapid expansion of
the anime industry has resulted in a dearth of
creativity that is leading the industry to a dead-end.11
Interest in Japanese animation in America has
occurred in waves,12 each of which left a rising wake
of anime fans who extol the virtues of the medium as
an alternative to both Hollywood and any other
products of American popular culture.13 The first
wave occurred in the 1960s with Astro Boy (1963) and
Speed Racer (1968, originally Mach a Go Go Go). Star
Blazers arrived in the United States in 1978 (originally
Space Battleship Yamato from 1974), followed by
Robotech in 1985 (based on three series from 1982
onward). Akira was a major cult hit in 1988. Finally,
the 90s gave way to an exponential rise of titles and
anime interest. Some of the highlights include Sailor
Moon (1995), Dragonball/Dragonball Z (1995),
Pokemon (1998), and Princess Mononoke (1999).
2.2. Fan Distribution
Fan distribution comprises all of the methods by
which fans copied and disseminated anime to other
fans between 1976 and 1993.
2.3. Fansub
Fansub is short for fan subtitling, or fansubtitled
video. Fansubs are almost exclusively
subtitles of anime. Fansubs appeared in America in
1989 following the wide consumer availability of
Commodore Amiga and Macintosh computers, which
could overlay subtitles on top of a video stream with
extra hardware. The essential hardware for fansubbing
between 1989 and 1998 was a genlock, or generator
locking device. This device enables a video machine,
such as a TV, to accept two signals simultaneously.
When operational, a genlock synchronizes an
incoming video signal with computer output,
enabling the overlay of subtitles in real-time. The
results of a genlock system were then recorded on
another videocassette and distributed along a vast fan
network. Many fansubbers incorporated timesynchronized
VHS and S-VHS decks into their
fansubbing systems; by the mid 90s, these systems
allowed for near-perfect timing and accuracy of
subtitles and spoken dialogue.
Fans who subtitle videos are called fansubbers; a
team of fansubbers is known as a fansub group. A
fansub group traditionally consists of one or more
translators, editors, typesetters, timers, and first-tier
distributors. Fansubbers usually add credits or
identifying marks to their works, although they
almost always use pseudonyms for legal reasons.
Fansubbers additionally will add titles such as ÅgNOT
FOR SALE OR RENTÅh and ÅgCEASE DISTRIBUTION
WHEN LICENSEDÅh to their works, indicating that 2.3. Fansub 9/12/2004
Version 1.11-columnar Progress Against the Law Page 6 of 39
their works are not licensed, that no money should
change hands for their fansubs, and that viewers
should purchase the licensed products once they are
available domestically. Many fansubbers and
distributors used the self-addressed, stamped
envelope (SASE) system of distribution. This system
required no monetary exchange. Instead, fans would
send a self-addressed, stamped envelope with blank
tapes and instructions in it; they would get the tapes
back with the episodes recorded on them. Some
fansubbers, however, charged modest fees ostensibly
to cover the cost of the tape and postage.
Many fansubbers would include explanatory
subtitles or supertitles about Japan, Japanese culture,
or other tidbits of a subtitled anime in order to
elucidate the showÅfs more elusive references.
As this analysis ends at 1993, it does not cover
fansubs encoded in video files and distributed over
the Internet, also known as digisubs. Digisubs first
appeared in the late 1990s.

Version 1.11-columnar Progress Against the Law Page 7 of 39
3. Historical Analysis of Fan
Distribution and Subtitling
We present an original history of the fan
movement in the United States. This history has been
compiled and verified from a series of personal
interviews, fan artifacts, and other primary sources.
We provide appropriate citations for known
references from this period.
3.1. Pre-Fan Period
Japanese animation entered the United States
before 1975, but with varying degrees of adaptation.
The first documented films that were distributed
across the United States were Panda and the Magic
Serpent (Hakujaden) starting March 15, 1961,
followed by Magic Boy (Sh?nen Sarutoki Sasuke) on
July 8, 196114 and Alakazam the Great (Saiy?ki) on
July 26, 1961.15 While American producers had to
stick fairly close to what was onscreen for the graphics,
they changed much of the story to cater to American
childrenÅfs perceived tastes. Fred Ladd, who produced
the American versions of Astro Boy (1963), Gigantor
(1965), Kimba the White Lion (1965), and Speed Racer
(1967), was notorious for changing names16 and
editing plotlines. Before Astro Boy, Ladd was involved
with a Belgian production doing a modernization of
Pinocchio called Pinocchio in Outer Space. When NBC
bought the rights to Tetsuwan Atomu in 1963, the
company contacted Ladd because of his previous
work, which was similar to Tetsuwan Atomu. However,
these similarities were tenuous at best. American
production companies were used to completely
Americanizing foreign products, removing un-
American speech as well as all but the most scant of
references to the original Japanese production teams.
These shows turned out to be enormously
popular with Americans, however, and there is little
doubt that Ladd contributed towards the short-lived
success of Japanese animation in the 1960s.
Nevertheless, pressure to sanitize childrenÅfs television
in 1970s America paralleled dramatic advances in
violence and sexual content in Japanese animation,
largely due to the influence of Go NagaiÅfs Devilman
(1972), Mazinger Z (1972), and Cutey Honey (1973).
American networks decided to move cartoon shows
from weekday primetime?the former home of Astro
Boy and Speed Racer, alongside the classic The
Flintstones and The Jetsons?to Saturday mornings, at
which point a variety of parent groups pressured the
networks for an increased sanitization of animated
programming. Ladd points out, ÅgYou couldnÅft give
away a Japanese-made series here [by the early
1970s].Åh17
A few Japanese cartoons did make it over to the
US and are worth noting. Gatchaman (as Battle of the
Planets, later G-Force) was brought over in 1978. The
former production was significantly sterilized, and
both productions remained too unpopular to be
sustained on American television. Space Battleship
Yamato aired in 1978 with minimal retooling as Star
Blazers, proving more successful. Its popularity was
confined to the East Coast, however, explaining the
prevalence of East Coast Star Blazers fandom. Finally,
Voltron18 made significant inroads into the childrenÅfs
market in America in 1984-1986; its sanitization
could be described as halfway between Star Blazers
and Battle of the Planets. In all these cases, however,
showsÅf Japanese origins were strictly eradicated.
Japanese animation interest would surface again in
the next decade, but its driving force was a very
different market: the micro-market created by fans.
3.2. Technology Change;
Cartoon/Fantasy Organization
Post-Astro Boy anime penetration spread
through the United States within three months of the
release of the first video cassette recorders in
November 1975. By March 1976, Japanese community
TV stations in the United States started running
subtitled giant robot cartoons, such as Getter Robo.
These stations had been running Japanese cartoons
beforehand, but their previous broadcasts were aimed
at very young children. Thanks to the availability of
VCRs, science fiction and comics fans could record
these new shows and show them to their friends.
Fred Patten, founder of the first anime club in
the United States, described his experience in detail.
PattenÅfs first exposure to anime occurred at the Los
Angeles Science Fiction Society (LASFS) in 1976.
During one of the weekly meetings, Patten met up
with another fan who was an early adopter of SonyÅfs
Betamax technology. The fan said, ÅgYouÅfve got to look
at this recording I made of this Japanese science
fiction animated cartoon,Åh and proceeded to show it at
one of the societyÅfs meetings.
Over the next year, the fan brought a number of
recorded Japanese giant robot cartoons with English
subtitles to the science fiction club. Additionally, 3.3. Japanese Enter and Abandon the Market 9/12/2004
Version 1.11-columnar Progress Against the Law Page 8 of 39
several other fans recorded shows from Japanese
community TV and showed them at various fan
events. At the time, fans were amazed that the
Japanese cartoons depicted so much more violence
than cartoons in the United States. A standard plot
device in the Japanese cartoons, for example, was that
the heroÅfs father had been killed by the villain, that
entire cities were blown up, and that the hero had to
survive in the aftermath of a ruined world.19 Whether
or not these cartoons showed any graphic bloodshed,
it was obvious that hundreds of thousands of people
were supposed to have been killed. In American
cartoons from 1976-1980, no one was ever hurt in
even the so-called action-adventure, or superhero,
cartoons. Villains in American cartoons could do little
more than make a few ugly faces.
In 1977, a small group of fans, Patten included,
decided that they liked the Japanese cartoons so much
that they should found a separate club so that they
could watch them on a regular basis, instead of
watching them at odd hours at a general fan party. At
these fan parties, it was common for a proponent of a
Japanese cartoon to propose to watch it, but he?
usually he at the time?would be voted down by the
majority who preferred American fare. In May 1977,
these fans started the Cartoon/Fantasy Organization
(C/FO), meeting regularly on the third Saturday of
each month.
In November 1977, fans from the C/FO in LA
started corresponding with other Japanese animation
fans around the country. They found out that while
they were showing Japanese cartoons in other cities,
the cartoons were not always the same. Los Angeles
and New York City were getting different sets of
cartoons: New York was getting Cyborg 00920 and
Galaxy Express 999,21 for example, which were not
being shown in Los Angeles. Consequently, the fans
started trading tapes back and forth.
At that time, many LASFS members maintained
pen pal relationships with other science fiction fans
around the world. Most of them were in Englishspeaking
countries, but a few of them had
correspondents in Japan. As a result, C/FO members
began to trade videos with Japanese fans who wanted
Star Trek and Battlestar Galactica. C/FO members
were interested in the Japanese science fiction
cartoons that were not being shown in Los Angeles
television, and it was a fortunate coincidence for the
fans that both the United States and Japan used the
NTSC system for broadcast, so that video tapes could
be played in both countries.
Of course, the tapes that the fans received from
Japan were not subtitled at all: fans had to watch them
in pure Japanese. By the late 1970s, the majority of
Japanese cartoons remained simple enough so that
the average viewer could discern their plots just from
watching their visuals, such as in Space Battleship
Yamato (1974) and Space Battleship Yamato 2 (1978).
Because there was no other alternative, fans reported
that they were happy enough to watch untranslated
shows. By 1979, fans and clubs, who had recently
established an independent identity from the science
fiction movement, began using the term anime.
C/FO was not the only anime club in existence
by this time. For instance, there were very big fan
clubs in Boston, in New York, and in Philadelphia.
There was a mobile fan club on the East Coast that
called itself the Gamelan Embassy, named after the
antagonists from Space Battleship Yamato. The
Gamelans were devoted to showing Japanese
animation at the science fiction and comic book
conventions in the New England and Mid-Atlantic
regions. Starting in 1980, they would show anime
programs in one of their hotel rooms at science
fiction conventions. The Gamelans put out fliers
throughout these conventions, reading, ÅgIf you want
to see Japanese animation come up to room XYZ,Åh
and, ÅgWeÅfre going to be showing it all night long.Åh
3.3. Japanese Enter and Abandon
the Market
Throughout this period, it was considered
socially acceptable to show whatever Japanese
animation anybody could get on videotape without
trying to get permission from the Japanese companies,
because almost none of the Japanese studios had
offices in America. The few that did?Toei
Animation, Tokyo Movie Shinsha (TMS, now TMS
Entertainment), and Tatsunoko?automatically said
no because their local representatives did not have the
authority to permit those uses. Furthermore, they
were not going to take the trouble to ask Tokyo if a
group of American teenage fans could show one of
their cartoons to other fans for free. The
representatives in America knew what the answer
from Tokyo was going to be: absolutely not.
At this time, Patten became officially involved
with these animation studios. This section describes
PattenÅfs involvement in detail, revealing that the 3.3. Japanese Enter and Abandon the Market 9/12/2004
Version 1.11-columnar Progress Against the Law Page 9 of 39
Japanese were unsuccessful in accessing the American
market because they perceived that the barrier to
entry was too high.
In 1978, Toei Animation established its first
regular office in North Hollywood. Toei launched its
office to try to promote its animation in the West,
after nearly a decade of inactivity. Toei discovered the
C/FO and asked if its members could help them do
some marketing research. Toei provided merchandise
for test marketing at the San Diego Comic-Con,
where Patten ran the first American fan convention
dealerÅfs table, replete with anime merchandise. Toei
provided a sample of what they considered their boysÅf
and their girlsÅf TV programming. Captain Harlock22
dominated the boysÅf material, and Candy Candy23
dominated the girlsÅf. The boysÅf merchandise sold very
well, but almost no one was interested in the girlsÅf
materials. Mrs. Hozumi, a Toei representative, also
brought 16mm reels of the untranslated pilot episodes
of a number of their TV programs of that time: the
first episode of Captain Harlock, the first episode of
Captain Future,24 the first episodes of their giant robot
cartoons, and a few first episodes from their girlsÅf
cartoons. Fans were fascinated with how different
these cartoons were from American offerings.
Hozumi took copious notes on everything that
happened at the convention, which she sent back to
Tokyo.
Back in Hollywood, Tatsunoko in 1979 told fans
that, ÅgWe are aware that you American fans are having
screenings of some of our cartoons without getting
our permission, and we cannot really allow you to do
this officially. By the way, though, we would like some
of these cartoons to be shown to Hollywood
executives. Could you show them your copies of these
cartoons?Åh Japanese studios?at least Toei, TMS and
Tatsunoko?were very obviously aware that fans were
engaged in unauthorized distributions and screenings,
but their feelings were very mixed. While they could
not support the fan activity in principle, as evidenced
by their unwillingness to license these rights, they
knew that fans were not profiting from their activities,
and that the studios were getting free publicity out of
it.
The next year, TMS provided a subtitled 35mm
print of Lupin III: Castle of Cagliostro for showing at
the 1980 World Science Fiction Convention in Boston,
Noreascon II. Patten, in concert with convention
volunteers, created survey forms for the screening.
The survey forms asked questions such as ÅgHow did
you like this movie?Åh and, ÅgDo you think that this
movie would be popular with the American public?Åh
Patten urged viewers to fill out a form before they left
the screening; once completed, he sent them back to
TMS.
By 1982, however, the Japanese studios finally
realized that they were not going to succeed in the
American market. There was one exception: in an
incident quite unrelated to Toei/TMS/Tatsunoko, the
endearing Sea Prince and Fire Child (Japanese Syrius
no Densetsu, or The Legend of Syrius, 1981) by Sanrio
Communications was licensed to RCA/Columbia
Pictures Home Video for a direct-to-video release in
1982.25 While this release was obscure, it remains
memorable among its few American fans. The last
known commercial push came from Toei Animation
when it was trying to sell its first Galaxy Express 999
theatrical feature to the major American movie
studios. Toei again recruited C/FO members to help
send out invitations to Hollywood studio
representatives for a test screening in Burbank, about
two blocks from the Warner Bros. studio. However, no
Hollywood executives attended the screening.
By the end of the year, Toei sold Galaxy Express
999 to Roger CormanÅfs New World Pictures, which
had gained infamy as a low-budget exploitation
company.26 New World Pictures significantly altered
Galaxy Express 999, destroying its intricately woven
story in place of a failure aimed at younger children.
Toei was highly disappointed. They told the C/FO,
ÅgThank you for all the help youÅfve given us. WeÅfve
decided we do not want to follow this any further at
the moment.Åh They closed their American office and
returned to Japan.
For most of the 1980s there was no longer any
real contact between the Japanese studios and the
American fans, with a few minor exceptions. In 1987 a
Japanese company called Gaga Communications, a
large, Japanese theatrical and TV marketing
company,27 had promotional responsibilities for a
number of Japanese movies. In 1987 they held
promotional screenings at LA comic book
conventions for a number of movies and original
animated videos (OAVs). The Guyver and Wicked City
were among them. In addition to showing these titles
to fans, they had invited a number of Hollywood
studio representatives to come to the screening. Their
clear intention was to surround these representatives
with fans whom they hoped would be very
enthusiastic, so the representatives could see how 3.4. Fan Activity Increases 9/12/2004
Version 1.11-columnar Progress Against the Law Page 10 of 39
popular these were with American teenagers. Again,
the effort proved fruitless.
However, in 1988 Gaga was at least successful
selling Wicked City to Streamline Pictures, the first
anime specialty company, started by Carl Macek and
Jerry Beck. Macek and Beck were very aware of Gaga
Communications and negotiated with them regularly.
A discussion of Streamline continues, however, later
in this analysis (see page 24).
3.4. Fan Activity Increases
One year after the Japanese backed out of the
American market in 1982, an American, Frederick L.
Schodt, would publish his seminal work Manga!
Manga! The World of Japanese Comics,28 documenting
for the first time in English the vitality and ubiquity
of manga in Japan. By this time Schodt was no
foreigner to Japanese ways: he was one of the few
non-military Americans studying Japanese in the
1970s, and through a series of twists and turns,
managed to strike up a friendship with Osamu Tezuka
after surprising the comic author with his flawless
Japanese.29 Dr. Tezuka had a few choice words for the
foreword of Manga! Manga!, speaking on the topic of
the slow acceptance of manga outside Japan:
This is why Japanese animation?
which is dubbed and doesnÅft
confuse the reader by ÅereadingÅf in
one direction or another?has been
able to open the door for Japanese
comics overseas where printed
materials have failed. Having solved
the problem of language, animation,
with its broad appeal, has in fact
become JapanÅfs supreme goodwill
ambassador, not just in the West but
in the Middle East and Africa, in
South America, in Southeast Asia,
and even in China. The entry port
is almost always TV. In France the
children love watching Goldorak.
Doraemon is a huge hit in Southeast
Asia and Hong Kong. Chinese
youngsters all sing the theme to
Astro Boy.30
Dr. TezukaÅfs words were very true from what he knew
in 1983. As he would write these words, however, a
very different Ågentry portÅh was emerging in the West:
the networks of organized anime fandom.
After the Japanese companies backed out of the
American market in 1982, there were no moral or
legal forces to discourage fans from copying and
distributing tapes amongst themselves. From the late
1970s the end of the 1980s, there were movements to
establish national and international fan clubs with
chapters in a number of cities. The Cartoon/Fantasy
Organization was the first of these. There was also the
Earth Defense Force, which was mainly a Star Blazers
(the American release of Space Battleship Yamato)
club with some interest in other programs. These
clubs all had chapters in a number of cities; the theory
behind them was that they could promote anime
much more efficiently, and could get more anime for
the chapters in different cities to watch, if the chapters
united through a central organization.
The visual quality of tapes started deteriorating
as more fans developed in America because fans
started making multi-generation copies of the videos.
Visual quality remained high within the first year
after C/FO members began to receive tapes from
people in Japan. By the early 1980s, however, some of
the copies C/FO members reported were 15th to 20th
generation copies, which were extremely poor. It
became common for fans to compare video quality
between their tapes. For example, one fan might bring
his copy of the first Urusei Yatsura tape, somebody
else would bring his copy of the same one, and they
would compare them and see if one was of noticeably
better video quality. The better quality tape would
eventually be shown.
Many fans also experienced ideological conflicts
as the fandom grew between the early 1980s through
the early 1990s. Patten reports, for example:
I got into some pretty bitter
arguments with some fans in the
early 80s [within the C/FO] that
thought we should not try to
promote Japanese anime, that we
ought to keep it a small select group,
you know?neat stuff that only we
were aware of. I have always
disputed it.
In 1985, the Gamelan Assembly announced that they
were dissolving because anime was now popular
enough that conventions were scheduling their own
official anime rooms. They had achieved their
purpose, so they no longer had to do it themselves.
An overwhelming majority of fans, however, felt
that anime should expand to more segments of the 3.5. Anime Importers Fail to Release Quality Material 9/12/2004
Version 1.11-columnar Progress Against the Law Page 11 of 39
American public, even if that meant a radical change
in the constitution of the fandom. A few fans, for
example, began to write translation booklets to
accompany untranslated anime programming at clubs
and conventions. A translation booklet would usually
be twenty-five to thirty pages with the entire dialogue
for a full length movie or a batch of episodes.
Translators would publish the booklet in fanzine
format, i.e., as an amateur-produced magazine written
for a subculture of fans.31 The booklets sold for $2 or
$3 per copy to recoup the translatorÅfs costs of
production.
The first well-known translation booklet
presented the text in Rumiko TakahashiÅfs Urusei
Yatsura theatrical feature Only You, produced by
Toren V. Smith in June 1985.32 Anyone who was really
interested could try to read the booklet and watch the
movie at the same time. There were at least three or
four other writers of translation booklets: one of
whom was located near the Great Lakes, a couple on
the East Coast, and one David Riddeck of LA. Toren
Smith eventually moved from publishing these
booklets to starting up Studio Proteus, a company that
went on to do professional translations for American
comic book companies. Along with other anime fans,
David Riddeck started up US Renditions, a brief-lived
anime specialty company.
Plot synopses booklets also existed: each booklet
contained up to a full page synopsis of the action in
an anime film (the most common) or the episodes in
a TV series. These synopses booklets were more
common at some of the science fiction conventions in
the mid-to-late 80s that had regular anime rooms,
largely because of an identical practice among science
fiction fandom. A couple of conventions?Balticon,
for example?would publish these booklets of plot
synopses, some of which totaled over a hundred pages.
Some fans took the booklet format even further,
publishing a comprehensive guide to Space Battleship
Yamato, covering its original Japanese version along
with its American Star Blazers counterpart.
Translators and compilers of these books
considered their work the American equivalents of
roman albums and other anime specialty books that
were being published in Japan. Called by the same
term in Japanese, roman albums are compilations of
production stills and information from various
anime; they are highly prized among collectors.
Authors of translation and plot synopses booklets
were interested in more than the $3 per book: they
wanted the prestige within the anime fan community
of publishing something that all American fans would
want. The practice of publishing booklets continued
for at least five years, until fansubbed and commercial
anime became more readily available.
Starting around 1986, a number of fans wanted
to build up a professional anime magazine presence in
the US that they hoped would approach the number
of magazines about anime that existed in Japan. For
instance, Rob Fenelin of New Jersey was part of a
group that wanted to publish the American equivalent
of Animage, Newtype, and other monthly professional
Japanese anime magazines. Fenelin published three or
four issues of Animezine from New Jersey; two fans
on the West Coast named Trish Ledoux and Toshi
Yoshida published Animag, which ran twelve to
thirteen issues.33 Protoculture Addicts began in
Montreal. Most of these magazines appeared very
professionally published,34 and most of them
contacted the Japanese studios to get professionalquality
graphics along with permission to publish.
However, they were all such small scale activities that
most could not afford to continue for more than a few
issues, if they sold issues only to the fans. Getting
newsstand distribution was, and would remain,
extremely difficult for a small fan group. With the
exception of Protoculture Addicts, which grew very
slowly over a number of years, most of these
magazines published only half a dozen to a dozen
issues. It would not be until Viz started up with
Animerica (1992) with the Japanese mega-publisher
Shogakukan behind it that a regular American anime
magazine would be established. Toren Smith, David
Riddeck, and others in the mid 80s wanted to take fan
projects beyond the fan bases and turn them
professional; Trish Ledoux and Toshi Yoshida
ultimately succeeded with Viz and Animerica. For the
other two, publishing translation booklets turned out
to be a good starting point.
3.5. Anime Importers Fail to
Release Quality Material
Attempts by the fans to convince the 1980s
video and movie industries to release Japanese
animation were consistently turned down flat. The
only exceptions were a small handful of B-grade
movie companies that would buy Japanese cartoons
with the express intent of carving them up into
ÅgkiddyÅh cartoon movies. When Roger Corman
obtained the rights to Galaxy Express 999, for example, 3.5. Anime Importers Fail to Release Quality Material 9/12/2004
Version 1.11-columnar Progress Against the Law Page 12 of 39
he did more than Ågcamp it up.Åh In another instance, in
voice dubbing Captain Harlock, New World Pictures
gave Harlock a John Wayne accent.
Another tragedy of the 1980s was Celebrity
Home EntertainmentÅfs release of Revenge of the Ninja
Warrior (1985, Japanese Kamui no Ken, better known
as Dagger of Kamui), which was fortunately picked up
and given a proper treatment by AnimEigo after its
original license had expired. Kamui no Ken was a sort
of samurai/ninja story set during the transition of the
fall of the Tokugawa Shogunate and the reestablishment
of Japan under the Emperor Meiji in
1868. Celebrity Home Entertainment tried to turn it
into a science fiction adventure Ågset on a far away
planet,Åh even though Jiro, the main character,
eventually travels to America and meets Mark Twain
in Virginia City, Nevada. Celebrity Home
Entertainment made no attempt to be faithful to the
Japanese original; they just rewrote the script however
as they wanted.
Perhaps the most notorious example of
rewriting, however, is the revisionist Warriors of the
Wind (April 1986), based upon Hayao MiyazakiÅfs
Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind (1984). New World
Pictures cut a half hour out of it; they cut expenses
wherever possible and changed most character names.
Both Hayao Miyazaki and Isao Takahata were
appalled. In 1992, Takahata said of the edited version:
It is absolutely horrible! They did
an enormous and aberrant
censorship; they cut HisaishiÅfs
pieces of music, [not to mention]
the changed dialogues. It was a
great error of Studio Ghibli and we
havenÅft given broadcast rights to
foreign countries since, and weÅfll
never again give such rights without
an attentive examination of the
conditions beforehand. For that
matter, the international rights for
Nausicaa given to the U.S.A. will be
over in 2 or 3 years. All these
movies are grounded strongly in
Japanese culture and are not
conceived with an eye towards
exportation. Censoring them is
worse than betraying them.35
These edits, however grievous, were no worse
than most of the non-Disney animation movies that
Americans could see at that time. These animations
were universally of poor quality, whether somebody
elseÅfs adaptation of a Japanese animated feature or an
animated feature that was simply made cheaply in the
first place, from Fritz the Cat to the French movie
Fantastic Planet. Fantastic Planet had some
intellectual appeal; using an avant-garde, futuristic
animation style merely hid the fact that it employed a
very limited animation style. In general, however, if it
was animation, then it was for children, so producers
assumed that they needed to Ågdumb downÅh the plot,
whether the subject of mutilation was Warriors of the
Wind, Starchase of the Legend of Orin, the Felix the
Cat theatrical feature, or something else. Even with
the editing that New World Pictures did to Warriors
of the Wind, it was probably superior to many others:
it was poor only in comparison with the original
Japanese version.
Despite New World PicturesÅfs poor handling of
Nausicaa, fans were inspired by MiyazakiÅfs original, as
was increasingly obvious according to fan evidence
from the period following 1984. Patten recounts that,
because of NausicaaÅfs seminal influence, fans
organized the first anime tour to Tokyo in summer
1986 in order to see MiyazakiÅfs Laputa: Castle in the
Sky, as well as the landmarks that they had only
glimpsed in anime. Copied videos of the original
Nausicaa had come over to America; these videos
were quickly disseminated throughout the fan base.
When the American anime companies started up, the
first anime that all the fans wanted were MiyazakiÅfs
movies: evidence of this is provided throughout
Usenet archives and by Patten himself. He recounts, ÅgI
know that when I worked for Streamline in the
beginning of 1991, we were constantly getting letters
and even a few phone calls from fans saying Åewhy
arenÅft you getting Miyazaki movies? This is what we
really want to see.ÅfÅh
The first theatrical distribution right that
Streamline Pictures acquired was a one year license
for Laputa. Streamline was constantly renting Laputa
out for college and art house screenings. At the end of
the year Streamline wanted to renew the license, but
Tokuma would not allow it. Parallel to maneuverings
in the previous decade, Tokuma licensed Laputa to
Streamline so that the former could test-market the
film at StreamlineÅfs expense. Tokuma, like its
predecessor anime companies in the 1980s, was not
interested in dealing with small companies: Tokuma
wanted to strike a deal with one of the big American
studios, which they finally clinched with Disney in 3.6. C/FO at Its Height; C/FO in Japan 9/12/2004
Version 1.11-columnar Progress Against the Law Page 13 of 39
1996. Whether ultimately fortuitous or not, one fact is
clear: Tokuma, like all previous Japanese studios, was
unwilling to invest substantially in the American
market without a guaranteed payout.
3.5.1. The Robotech Exception and the Second
Wave
In spite of the aforementioned botched efforts,
anime made at least one faithful?and markedly
successful?foray into the commercial sector in the
mid 1980s. We now discuss the motivations of Carl
Macek, the producer of Robotech. In 1981, Macek ran
a comic book and movie memorabilia specialty shop
in Orange, California. Macek also assisted with
marketing and promotion for the movie Heavy Metal
during this period, leading him to research animation
that was not oriented toward the childrenÅfs market. At
the same time, there was an anime club starting up in
Orange: the Orange County branch of the
Cartoon/Fantasy Organization. They needed a new
meeting place, and Macek agreed to let them meet
once a month in his shop. Many of the members were
regular comic book customers of his. As he also sold
animation cels from American movies, he was always
interested in being friendly with the fans as a good
way to attract additional customers. These activities
introduced him to Japanese animation: after awhile,
he started importing some Japanese cels from
Tatsunoko to sell in his shop.
Macek became as much of a Japanese animation
specialist in America as existed at that time, leading
him to Harmony Gold to help create Robotech.
Harmony Gold representatives contacted Macek,
informing him that they had worldwide rights outside
Japan to a number of Japanese cartoon TV series.
They had bought the rights mainly to sell in Europe
and Latin America; they planned to dub these anime
into Italian, French, and Spanish. They wanted to try
and capitalize on their investment in America, but
they were not sure how to go about it. During this
period He-Man and the Masters of the Universe was
extremely popular with its 130 episodes.36 All of the
syndicated TV stations in America were clamoring
for similar shows with high episode counts going
beyond sixty-five episodes. Unfortunately, most of the
Japanese series at the time were too short.
Macek pointed out that Harmony Gold already
had the rights to Macross, which was associated with
Tatsunoko Productions, and that Tatsunoko had other
science fiction programs that were similar in nature
and that had been done in a similar art style.
Harmony Gold then replied that if Macek took three
of these and edited them together, he could make a
single series out of it. This possibility led to his
association with Harmony Gold and with Robotech,
which made him even more of an anime expert. He
began promoting Robotech by attending a number of
science fiction conventions, talking to the fans, and
finding out what the fans wanted. Through these
events, he became aware that there was a growing cult
interest in anime among the adolescent and young
adult public, one that was simply being ignored by the
entertainment establishment. The entertainment
executives at the time mistakenly inferred that if a
product was a cartoon, then it must be for young
children in order to sell well; since Japanese cartoons
were much too violent and complex in plot for young
children, they would not sell well. Based on his
experience with anime fandom, Macek edited Macross,
Orguss, and Southern Cross into Robotech, which
turned out to be a resounding commercial success.
Macek quickly gained notoriety in the fan
community for the serious re-editing required of the
Robotech saga, although he has asserted that the
decision to combine the three series was Harmony
GoldÅfs (ultimately, based on the market at the time).37
Nevertheless, we argue that Robotech was markedly
more faithful to its original anime series than other
commercial attempts during this period: it kept in, for
example, the pivotal love triangle between Hikaru
Ichijo (Rick Hunter), Lynn Minmay (Lynn Minmei),
and Misa Hayase (Lisa Hayes), the first love triangle
on both Japanese and American animated television.
Furthermore, we note the profound connection
between Robotech and MacekÅfs involvement with early
American fandom: the creator of this pivotal ÅgwaveÅh
of anime fans was none other than a fan himself who
relied extensively on the fan network that developed
at that time.
3.6. C/FO at Its Height; C/FO in
Japan
We return to a discussion of the
Cartoon/Fantasy Organization during the height of its
activity between 1985 and 1989. By this time, the
C/FO had over three dozen chapters throughout
America; it even maintained a chapter called C/FO
Rising Sun near an air force base in Japan. At this
point, the C/FO had established a massive official
system for the distribution of untranslated tapes
among its member chapters. In 1985, many of the 3.6. C/FO at Its Height; C/FO in Japan 9/12/2004
Version 1.11-columnar Progress Against the Law Page 14 of 39
C/FOÅfs videos not acquired through pen pal
relationships or Japanese family members were
acquired through Little Tokyo in Los Angeles,
Nipponmachi in San Francisco, the Japanese district of
New York, and other places that sold Japanese import
goods. These locations would have little ÅgMom and
PopÅh video stores that sold or rented original Japanese
videos. In addition, some store owners would request
their relatives in Japan to record and send Japanese
shows to them, at which point they would offer the
tapes for rent. Fans would purchase or rent these tapes,
copy them, and circulate them in the anime fan
community. Many of these tapes would have all of
the Japanese commercials and station break parts
intact between segments of anime programming.
Despite the well-developed network, in the mid 1980s
there emerged a dichotomy among the small anime
fandom, where there were ÅghavesÅh and there were
Åghave-nots.Åh Access to anime became a matter of who
you knew in order to gain access: once you knew the
right people, however, it was easy to access any anime
available, quality issues aside.
In Japan, however, another fan network was
forming led by James Renault38 and the fans at C/FO
Rising Sun. Renault became involved with anime
growing up overseas. His father was a military man:
throughout the 1960s and 1970s he was stationed at
Tachikawa airbase, and later Misawa airbase, in
northern Japan. Renault was cared for by a Japanese
nanny most of the time in his youth, during which he
watched a lot of Japanese television. He developed
relationships with Japanese pen pals, to whom he
would send tapes of American programming after his
family became one of the first families to own a
Betamax on the airbase.
Renault recounts that, in the late 1970s, he
traded tapes frequently with pen pals back in America.
Even if there were tapes that he did not intend to
watch, his family was able to trade them to other
military personnel, or to Japanese contacts. For
example, followers of Dallas39 had no way of following
that series while on Misawa airbase; Renault was able
to get the most recent tapes of ÅgWho Shot JR?Åh to
others on the base, giving them a connection to the
mainland U.S. that they otherwise would not have.
Renault returned to America to finish high
school and college. While in America, he met people
like Patten, Lori Eason, and the Hanisons in San
Francisco: all were serious archivists by the early
1980s. During the early 1980s, Renault watched the
C/FO grow and expand. He had little to do with
American fandom at this time; his main source of
anime was through his pen pals in Japan, who would
periodically send him interesting tapes. He would
occasionally Ågsit down and binge watch for hours at a
time,Åh but would not watch every day, nor would he
watch every tape he had.
As it turned out, Renault had many Japanese pen
pals. In fact, the majority of his pen pals eventually
went into the industry itself. They were considered
odd by Japanese standards: they wanted to do
animation, they wanted to do art, they wanted to do
television, they wanted to direct, and they wanted to
do movies, so they did. His pen pals included artists
like Kenichi Sonoda, Monkey Punch (who was a good
friend of RenaultÅfs father, as both were avid jazz
collectors), and Go Nagai. Through these animators,
Renault met many other people who were studying
under them, or otherwise were involved with them in
their studios. Through these connections he acquired
most of his anime directly from Ågthe source.Åh
Renault joined the military in 1986, and had the
great fortune to be sent back to the Misawa base at
which he was raised. He resumed contact with many
of his old pen pals and started sending more tapes,
since he was in the city and went shopping daily. He
reentered organized fandom. Later that year, he met a
gentleman by the name of Joshua Smith40 who was
the president and chief operator of C/FO Rising Sun.
The chapter consisted of six or seven die-hard fans
who were also all military people. This group
included Renault, Smith, Hillary Hutchinson,41
Ronald Davidson,42 and a few others. Hutchinson
served as the primary contact with C/FO San Antonio,
which had a large following at the time. Davidson
would later be a key player in several anime
conventions throughout America.
Renault would drive from Misawa to Tokyo
every weekend to shop, to drop ÅggoodiesÅh off to people
in studios, to build up relationships and find out what
was going on in the industry, and to follow up on
things he was reading in Japanese animation
magazines. For instance, he uncovered much of the
production data of the original Bubblegum Crisis
series as it was being developed. He learned how
anime were put together, a process that he would later
describe in his C/FO newsletter columns. Through his
methods, news of what was being developed would
get back to the United States before most of the anime
magazines were being published in any form. As with 3.7. C/FO Fan Distribution 9/12/2004
Version 1.11-columnar Progress Against the Law Page 15 of 39
the aforementioned translation booklets, C/FO
newsletters were perhaps the most insightful
publications that were being distributed before the
anime magazines, because in them fans would get the
synopses of all of the latest shows, would get colorful
art, and would get other information about fan
gatherings, sci-fi shows, and conventions where anime
was being screened.
3.7. C/FO Fan Distribution
Many of the people involved in the early days of
the fan network who were copying and sending tapes
were affiliated with the armed forces. If anime came
from Japan, and it was not from a Japanese national,
the person distributing it was probably in the
American military. The few nonmilitary American
nationals in Japan were usually conducting business;
with a few notable exceptions (e.g., the translator and
author Fred Schodt), they did not come to Japan
because of its popular culture.
Tapes sent by military personnel were sent
through military carriers, not by international mail.
Consequently, the postal service marked all USbound
mail with the postmark, ÅgSan Francisco, CA,
APO.Åh Many C/FO members thought that members in
the Rising Sun chapter were living in San Francisco,
because Rising Sun members would send parcels back
to California that would arrive in one day. Instead,
tapes were placed on a cargo planes bound for Travis
Air Force Base.
Led by Renault, C/FO Rising Sun applied
American military distribution techniques to their
operations. Smith worked in full time file line and
Renault worked part-time in supply. Renault applied
his experience to produce tapes on request, allowing
him to copy over forty tapes per week. When Renault
worked with the fansubbing group Teiboku Fansubs
in 1993,43 he again applied his logistics knowledge to
TeibokuÅfs distribution practices. He taught these
methods to other fansubbing and distribution groups
so that they could maximize their tape throughput.
The MIT Anime ClubÅfs archives confirm
RenaultÅfs account. A variety of tapes, including Dirty
Pair TV Episodes 1-13, 14-26, and OVAs 1-10, were
uncovered: based on RenaultÅfs information, we were
able to confirm the source?an air force base in
southern Japan with ties to C/FO Rising Sun?and
approximate date?1985 to 1986?of the TV
recordings, given that Dirty Pair TV was not aired on
Japanese TV or distributed on video until well after
1990. The chain of distribution for these tapes would
include the anime club at University of Texas at
Austin, which had direct distribution ties to C/FO
Rising Sun, and of which the MIT Anime Club
founder is an alumnus. The chain also may include
C/FO San Antonio, which held formal ties to C/FO
Rising Sun and informal ties to UT AustinÅfs anime
club. These data, coupled written accounts and oral
interviews, provide substantial evidence that C/FO
distributed anime materials widely throughout an
international fan network.
C/FOÅfs materials, however, remained in
untranslated Japanese. The tapes were essentially the
only anime available in America, with the limited
exception of anime broadcast by Japanese community
television. Reported Renault:
People were desperate for whatever
they could get, and part of what I
would do, and part of my job when
I was working as the chapter
director for C/FO Rising Sun was to
provide synopses for all the shows
we sent back. So, you had an idea of
what was happening with the
specific show. Even if it wasnÅft a
translation, it was just quick
synopsis so that people knew what
the storyline was when they picked
it up and started watching it. It was
actually very useful. Every now and
again weÅfd be able to dupe one of
our Japanese hanger-ons to actually
translate an episode, but that
usually took a lot of doing, usually a
lot of bribery of alcohol or
something a long those lines!
Renault described C/FOÅfs motivation for the
mass copying of tapes. He explained that, back in the
1970s and 1980s, there were no legal ramifications
because no parties had any interest in the
ramifications. At that time, there was no American
anime industry. ÅgEvery now and again, somebody
would pick up a license and bring a show to America
which they would dub over and change and so on.
Well, we werenÅft all that particularly interested in
watching that particular show, but we wanted to see
what the original looked like. That was our
motivation. Back then, the motivation was just to get
anime to the masses, and to that end, we spent a lot of
money and postage!Åh 3.8. Birth of Fansubbing; Collapse of C/FO 9/12/2004
Version 1.11-columnar Progress Against the Law Page 16 of 39
Tape fidelity remained a major drawback to this
distribution system, suggesting that exposure to
anime was this systemÅfs chief economic and social
advantage. Viewers of anime in the mid-to-late 1980s
suffered through Japanese commercials, shaky video,
and the ever-present language barrier.
Anime bootlegging?that is, the mass copying of
anime tapes for profit?was virtually nonexistent in
America at this time: some people tried, but their
operations quickly collapsed because, with one letter,
groups like the C/FO would be delighted to send the
untranslated Japanese materials for free. Bootleggers
could not match the C/FO in terms of quality, price,
or selection. C/FO chapters could obtain any show
that anybody wanted, and they could get the show for
the minimal cost of postage.
Ultimately, fan distribution through C/FOÅfs
efforts, particularly C/FO Rising Sun, sought to keep
anime free, but keep anime controlled within the
C/FO organization. C/FO chapters only sent material
to people who really wanted anime and who would
share it with other close friends, as least as far as the
C/FO could determine. C/FO chapters also adhered
to their Ågfree and controlledÅh philosophy when they
engineered their arrangements between clubs. Show it
to all of your friends in order to promote Japanese
animation. Assuming that a fan had access to the
network, he or she could access as many anime and
related goods as were available.
3.7.1. Fan Networks as Proselytization
Commons
In terms of the theorist Yochai Benkler,44 the
physical layer (the postal system) operated as a
commons for many types of media, but both U.S. law
and the logical layer (the C/FO organization)
restricted access to the physical layerÅfs contents. The
logical layer (the C/FO organization) operated under
control, and the content layer (anime) operated as a
commons directed towards a particular cause: to get
more anime to the masses. We dub the anime network
that existed during the 1980s a closed proselytization
commons. Like Lawrence LessigÅfs characterization of
the early Internet as an innovation commons,45 the
proselytization commons offered a world of
creativity?a world of difference?to those who had
access to it.
This commons of anime distribution, however,
existed several years before the widespread adoption
of the Internet. In succeeding years, many would build
their fortunes on this proselytization commons. In
practice, the commons of the mid 80s was closed: it
did not embrace the end-to-end principle of provider
neutrality.46 C/FO built a model of control into the
commons, assuming that it, the C/FO, controlled
access to the largest flows of anime throughout the
United States. This arrogance proved to be its
downfall, leaving the next generation to the
construction of a new, open proselytization commons.
3.8. Birth of Fansubbing;
Collapse of C/FO
The very first known fansub was documented at
C/FO Rising Sun, sent to that chapter by the late Roy
Black of C/FO Virginia in Blacksburg. Black sent
C/FO Rising Sun a third-generation copy of a fourth
or fifth generation copy of a Lupin III episode that
someone had genlocked with a Commodore Amiga
and had subtitled, scene by scene, so that the
translator could translate the entire episode. The
video was very choppy and grainy: its picture quality
had been completely bled out from successive copy
generations. Nevertheless, the tape represented the
first faltering steps of a revolution leap: for the first
time, a fan could watch an episode and fully
understand what was going on.
The Lupin III fansub turned out to be an
anomaly. The technology to fansub was extremely
expensive for an average fan (on the order of $4000 in
1986), and the time commitment to subtitle an
episode would stretch to over one hundred hours.
C/FO members did not expect to see more fansubs
come out in the near future after 1986, and to their
credit, they never did. Nevertheless, they reported
being Ågblown away at somebody having that level of
patience. It was kind of like giving the caveman fire. It
was just, now that we have it, we have to figure out
how weÅfre going to put it to use.Åh
Quite unrelated to the fansubbing incident,
however, C/FO began to show wane by the late 1980s.
In late 1988, established chapters refused to trade or
communicate with one another due to a great deal of
politicking: if a group had a larger membership or an
item of value, the group would withhold items from
another group to get something else that they wanted.
After awhile, many of the chapters fell into a deadlock,
which one fan described as a Ågwell, weÅfre not going to
talk to those guys since they have nothing of value to
usÅh stalemate.
In 1989 a power struggle ensued at the very top
of the C/FO. Fred Patten had basically done 3.9. New Clubs, New Fans, New Fansubbing 9/12/2004
Version 1.11-columnar Progress Against the Law Page 17 of 39
everything that he could do as the C/FOÅfs leader: he
led the group for over a decade, and became weary
from his long tenure. Patten felt that he should step
down for the organization and for anime to move to
the next level. Many accused Patten of disloyalty
because he began to write articles for general
magazines, rather than for the perpetually behindschedule
C/FO fanzine. Patten reasoned that if the
purpose of his fan involvement was to proselytize
anime and make it better known in America, it would
be certainly advantageous to publish his work in a
popular culture magazine instead of a club zine.
In other words, the high priest of the closed
proselytization commons recognized the value of an
open one, but the custodians of the closed commons
branded him a freethinking traitor.
Patten stepped down amidst the fury, but he did
not setup a clear line of succession. Furthermore, the
slow speed of postal mail exacerbated
communications difficulties, since electronic means
were still out of reach of most C/FO members. Much
infighting resulted, and in that infighting new leaders
came to power who wanted to change C/FO
operations to fit their own images. When they
asserted themselves, many members balked,
provoking a high volume of mudslinging and namecalling.
Although The C/FO promised unfettered access
to anime within its organization, access into C/FOÅfs
networks proved more difficult that one might expect.
To gain access, a group had to be a member
organization, and the group had to receive tapes
through C/FOÅfs central command, which originally
was in Los Angeles, but later moved to San Antonio.
The C/FO would bring in new charter members, but
then after awhile, Central Command stopped sending
tapes to those charter members on request, which
caused much strife. Many members complained, Ågwell,
I joined your organization, I paid the annual dues, and
IÅfm not getting the things were promised me, so why
should I pay the annual dues?Åh
The late 1980s became a rough time for fandom
because of the increased difficulty in obtaining
materials from these established groups, particularly
from C/FO San Antonio, C/FO Denver (C/Food), and
C/FO Sacramento. Most of the chapters seceded from
the C/FO, which ceased to exist as a conglomerate
organization in July 1989.47 In 1990, C/FO would be
referred to as Ågthe Collapsing Fan OrganizationÅh in
infamy of its tortuous demise.48
3.9. New Clubs, New Fans, New
Fansubbing
Right after the C/FO cratered, technology
changed and fansubbing became accessible to the
public. The rise of fansubbing has little relation to the
C/FOÅfs demise: indeed we concur with Julie Davis at
Animerica, who argues that the technological
innovation of affordable subtitling permitted both the
growth of fansubbing and the practicality of starting
up professional anime companies. Had AnimEigo, U.S.
Renditions, and other companies tried to start before
1986 or 1987, they would have quickly folded due to
the expense of producing subtitled videotapes. Our
evidence supports this assertion: fansubs and anime
companies started at about the same time. This
analysis reveals a critical dependency, however:
companies were equally dependent on the fan base as
they were on the rapidly declining price of technology.
It is very difficult to determine whether the first
widely available anime was a fansub or commercial
release: that determination rests on the definition of
Ågwidely available.Åh There were a few poorly
documented ventures into subtitling in the 1980s: an
unconfirmed report of Nausicaa shown subtitled at
the Indianapolis Comic Book Show (August 1989),49
the debut of a subtitled Bubblegum Crisis 6 shown
January 20, 1990,50 and a subtitled version of My
Neighbor Totoro shown January 23, 1990,51 followed in
the upcoming months with Project A-ko and Etranger.
AnimEigo debuted a sneak preview of MADOX-01 at
the 1989 WorldCon on September 1-2,52 but it would
be until April 4, 1990 that MADOX-01 actually
reached video distribution.53 It is known that Robert
Woodhead and Roe Adams of AnimEigo subtitled
Vampire Princess Miyu OVA 1 in late 1988,54 but this
ÅgfansubÅh never saw distribution, at least not until a
commercial release in 1992. Furthermore, US
Renditions beat AnimEigo by three months with their
January 1990 releases of Gunbuster Vol. 1 and Dangaio
Part 1, both professionally subtitled.55
After reviewing the evidence, we conclude that
the earliest, widely-distributed release was the first
two episodes of Ranma ?, fansubbed under the
Ranma Project which started at BayCon in San Jose,
CA in May 1989.56 Members of the Ranma Project
would buy Japanese laserdiscs and subtitle from them,
resulting in a clean, pristine copy. Although Usenet
and interview sources concede that other subtitling
projects existed, the Ranma Project represented the 3.9. New Clubs, New Fans, New Fansubbing 9/12/2004
Version 1.11-columnar Progress Against the Law Page 18 of 39
first coordinated subtitling effort that successfully
distributed its tapes throughout the country and
exhibited its work at AnimeCon Åf91 over the hotelÅfs
video system.57 All references to previous work
strongly imply that those works saw little, if any,
distribution. In any case, these ÅgfansubsÅh could not be
distributed until the re-establishment of a fan
distribution network following the demise of the
C/FO.
Significantly, we find additional evidence of
Japanese inaction in the Ranma ProjectÅfs charter post,
as well as a kernel of thought developed throughout
the fansubbing movement:
> Also, are the subtitled episodes
mentioned available anywhere???
No. This is where the problems
[come] in.
Since we do not have the official
rights to do any of these, we really
cannot 'sell' these on the open
market. I have given a number of
copies away, with my blessing to the
[recipients] to copy the hell out of it,
but this is a VERY grey area. I fully
expect to either be told to stop by
Kitty Films (which I would) or be
sued the s$!t out of, which would
only make potential audiences over
here [very] mad [Åc]
The reality just may be that they
just don't care, period. A well
known comic book writer who's
spent a lot of time in Japan (come
on...you should know who this is....)
said that when he met with some
executives in a couple of studios
and let them know the 'piracy'
situation [thatÅfs] going on here, they
said they didn't care what went on
over here. Was this because of the
yen-dollar exchange wouldn't make
it profitable for anything to be
released here, or they just think of
us as a bunch of [weird]
Americans.58
Perhaps even more remarkable was the speed of the
ProjectÅfs subtitling and distribution: within weeks of
the LDs being released, members of the Project
subtitled and distributed the episodes. While the
Ranma Project was active, it managed to subtitle the
first two seasons of Ranma ?, some Maison Ikkoku,
and a smattering of other titles. The Project lasted
through January 1992.59
3.9.1. Reverse Imperialism
The rise of fansubbing and the rise of the anime
industry paralleled other major social shifts. For
example, the constitution of the fandom shifted to a
large college-age base. New college anime clubs
supported their anime interest: UT Anime in 1986,
Cornell Japanese Animation Society (CJAS, once CJS)
in variously September 1988 or late 1989,60 Cal-
Animage in January 1989, Purdue Animation in 1990,
and the MIT Anime Club in September 1990, to
mention a few. Owing in part to the demographic
shift and the rise of many anime-related activities in
the San Francisco Bay area, Internet?particularly
Usenet?usage rose dramatically among anime fans.
We remind the reader that these activities also
paralleled post-Cold War globalization. Russia was
already destabilizing. Soldiers who remained overseas
started to return home. The telecommunications
industry started to pick up. There were many world
events happening all at one time, and few realized
exactly what was going on in the world, let along what
was going on with this fandom: the pull of culture
into a dominant America, Ågreverse imperialism,Åh in the
absence of mature animated programming. Just as
subtitling technology began to be readily affordable
among fans, so too did frequent business trips to
Japan become affordable and convenient for anime
industry leaders. John OÅfDonnell of Central Park
Media, Robert Woodhead of AnimEigo, and John
Ledford of A.D. Vision were able to travel to Japan
much more freely because the threat of an actual
Soviet invasion was lifted, coupled with JapanÅfs much
longer promotion as one of AmericaÅfs active trade
partners.
3.9.2. Organizing an Open Proselytization
Commons
For the first anime fansubbers, however, these
macro concerns were irrelevant: their chief aim was to
spread anime as far and wide as possible. They
formed, in essence, an open proselytization commons
into which anyone was welcome. This subsection
describes that early formation.
Fansubbing groups usually ran at the whim of
their translators: the shows that groups subtitled were 3.10. Conventions 9/12/2004
Version 1.11-columnar Progress Against the Law Page 19 of 39
usually those that their translators enjoyed. This
dependence on translators answers the ruminations
of many fans during this period, Ågwell, why did
somebody do Saint Seiya, or why did somebody do
this?Åh The subtitled version was produced because the
translator liked that show, not because the market
demanded it. Indeed, the Ranma Project started on
the premise that since Ranma ? might never be
released commercially, it was worth the ProjectÅfs
efforts to translate Ranma ? and show it to fans.
As subtitling groups became more organized,
fansubbers began to talk to one another: many of
them were in college, so many of them had access to
the Internet. By 1993, fansubbers (the first known
reference to the videos as ÅgfansubsÅh was made in
March 1993)61 coordinated with one another to
prevent releasing two translations for the same show;
this cooperation also allowed fansub groups to
monitor one another. Anime fansubbers grew from
zero groups to about four between the foundation of
the Ranma Project and AnimeCon Åf91, then to eight
groups in the following span of about six months.
Numbers increased to fifteen following Anime
Expo Åf92, where it remained for about two years. A
couple of groups folded, but then a couple of other
groups took their place. The number of groups
multiplied in 1993, increasing into the mid 90s.
In the earliest days (1989-1990), fansubbers
served as their own distributors: they copied tapes
individually to anyone who requested them. A tiered
distribution system quickly replaced this model,
enabling a much wider spread of fansubs. One
fansubber recounts that if he could produce twelve
tapes a week, he would be fine. When distribution
started to really ramp up, i.e., when fans started
getting Internet access in increasing numbers and
started becoming aware that additional titles were
available, distribution demands Ågexploded.Åh
In a few cases, the fansubbing group would
establish a subcommittee, usually a single person, to
manage distribution. More likely, other groups such as
college-based clubs allied with fansubbers to
distribute the fansubs to other clubs. Written records
state, for example, that the Ranma Project and others
were closely affiliated with college anime clubs.
Although these groups were rarely official organs of
college anime clubs, the fansub groups performed a
service that provided college students with firsthand
exposure to anime.
Consider William Chow of the Vancouver
Japanese Animation Society, Canada, who was the
first major fansub distributor. His Arctic Animation
outfit sent out copies of subtitled anime as early as
November 1990,62 and continued to distribute tapes
well into the mid 90s. ChowÅfs advantage lay in his
connections to fansubbing groups, which he made
well before other distribution groups. Chow actively
pursued these groups, getting them involved in a
larger network of distribution. He gained a degree of
notoriety in the fan community because of his
insistence at charging for tapes instead of using the
SASE (self-addressed, stamped envelope) method,
placing him in the eyes of some as a bootlegger.
Evidence suggests, however, that Chow and other
Arctic Animation associates made little if any money
off of their subtitling operations, and that they
provided a highly beneficial in-between service for
fansubbers and fans until Arctic itself was backlogged
by over a yearÅfs worth of requests by 1994. Chow also
distributed to college anime clubs since ArcticÅfs first
days, suggesting that he too had a provided ÅgfirstexposuresÅh
of anime to the new audience.63
3.10. Conventions
The rise of clubs, industry, and fansubbing gave
rise to anime conventions: gatherings where fans and
newcomers alike could revel in Japanese animation
and its related offerings. We consider the effects of
these earliest conventions, particularly as they relate
to the availability of fansubbed and licensed materials.
3.10.1. AnimeCon Åf91
AnimeCon Åf91 (San Jose) was well-attended by a
lot of fans old and new who were interested in anime,
but many of them expected an experience that they
ultimately did not obtain. They were excited about
having an anime convention, but many of them came
out none the wiser because they could not understand
what they were watching: most of the screening
material was raw Japanese. For this reason, the Society
for the Promotion of Japanese Animation (SPJA)
transformed AnimeCon Åf91 into Anime Expo Åf92 (Los
Angeles), at which they planned to cater to American
audiences with subtitled screenings.
An out-of-print edition of A-ni-me: The Berkeley
Journal of Japanese Animation sheds light on the
motivation of at least one fan, Mike Tatsugawa: the
founder of Cal-Animage and the chairman for 3.10. Conventions 9/12/2004
Version 1.11-columnar Progress Against the Law Page 20 of 39
AnimeCon Åf91. In A-ni-me Vol. 1 Issue II, TatsugawaÅfs
ÅgEditorÅfs NoteÅh contains:
Japanese animation, which used to
be shown in small back rooms of
science fiction/fantasy conventions
now has its own convention where
the fans can watch their favorite
movies and videos in 16mm or
35mm. [Åc]
What fandom is witnessing is truly
a rare sight and one that we should
all stop and appreciate?the
transformation of a medium. [Åc]
No longer do we have to settle for
fifth generation tapes as our source
of entertainment, or word-ofmouth
synopses of videos. [Åc] If
A-ni-me had been done two or
three years earlier, we wouldnÅft have
even thought about asking the
Japanese right holders for
permission to print scripts to their
movies. [Åc] Our job several years
ago was to expand the Japanese
animation fandom base through
any means possible. Now, our task
has changed. There is still a need to
get more fans involved in anime,
but there are more ways to do it
now than at any other point in our
short history. Subbing videos was
great a few years ago, and in my
opinion is still great today, but now
we must work with the companies
willing to expand into the
American market [Åc]. ItÅfs time for
animation fans to leave the cradle
and start pushing harder than ever
before to bring anime into the
mainstream. The anime explosion is
about to happen. The only question
is whether we are willing to accept
the results.Åh64
The vast majority of shows at AnimeCon Åf91
were licensed from Japanese licensors, but were
screened without subtitles. Consider Wings of
Honneamise, shown at AnimeCon Åf91. Honneamise is
a classic anime with complex dialogue that cannot be
inferred from the filmÅfs visuals; without a thorough
understanding of Japanese, viewers would be totally
lost. If viewers made up the story as they went along,
they could concoct many different translations based
on the subsequent actions in the film; of course, those
interpretations would be completely wrong. To that
end, reported convention executives, the SPJA
discovered why subtitling was necessary at
conventions: so that newcomers could better
understand and get into anime.
There were a handful of subtitled anime at
AnimeCon Åf91, however: the Ranma ? and Maison
Ikkoku fansubs, as well as the few industry releases
available, were shown. Furthermore, evidence suggests
that Gainax brought a subtitled film print of the
second episode of Gunbuster.65 While attendance data
is unavailable, written reports suggest that fans were
rabid for the fansubbed material: a few fans began
reporting that their first ÅgrealÅh anime exposure was
through the Ranma ? fansubs.
Despite this activity, we note the continuing
reluctance of Japanese companies to support
American industry and fandom. Although Gainax
made an official appearance at AnimeCon Åf91 and at
certain sci-fi conventions in preceding years, GainaxÅfs
presence was an exception rather than the rule, owing
more to the pro-fan orientation of its staff than any
sentiment in the Japanese industry.
Another unfortunate incident of AnimeCon Åf91
was the U.S. Manga Corps. screening of I Give My All
(Japanese Minna Agechau), which was quickly pulled
from American distribution in a snafu with the
Japanese licensor, Sony. Fox TV news and the LA
Times besieged the event in their desire to know
about the new wave of ÅgJapanese Pornography,Åh
perpetuating the stereotype of anime as characterized
by pornographic content. Incensing fans and industry
alike, the incident motivated more than a few fan
groups to combat this characterization by releasing
more non-pornographic anime through the fansub
network.
3.10.2. Anime Expo and Anime America 1992-
1993
Armed with all of these experiences, the staff of
Anime Expo Åf92 expended significant effort securing
permissions from Japanese and American companies
to screen subtitled anime. For untranslated Japanese
materials, AX staff secured permissions to create and
screen subtitles. Harvey Jackson66 reports these
activities were the case during his involvement with
Anime Expo Åf92, Anime America Åf93 (San Francisco), 3.10. Conventions 9/12/2004
Version 1.11-columnar Progress Against the Law Page 21 of 39
and Anime Expo Åf93 (Los Angeles). When Jackson ran
programming for these conventions, he contacted all
of the companies, got their permissions to screen, and
explicitly asked them if the convention could have
permission to screen materials subtitled. Japanese
companies began to comply more readily, and since
American companies knew they were not going to
have a finished product by the time the convention
rolled around, they reasoned that pre-screenings
would be a great way to pre-market their wares. The
Japanese would give the convention permission to
subtitle, so long as the American companies approved
the script that the convention would ultimately use.
As companies became bigger and met more of their
deadlines, they began to fear the risk of a faulty script
being used, and did not wish to become victims of the
comparison bug?that is, the comparison that some
fans make when they watch a sub at a convention that
appears to be better than the sub that a company
releases. After 1993, American companies started
cracking down, limiting conventions to the raw
Japanese version if they wanted to screen anything at
all.
Anime Expo Åf92, however, had to subtitle all of
its programming. Cal-Animage founder and AX
Convention Chair Mike Tatsugawa, in his wisdom,
realized that English subtitling was necessary to get
people really interested in anime. When the
convention rolled around, nearly everything the
convention showed was subtitled by fans. When
convention attendees discovered that local fansub
groups had translated many of the convention
materials, they all wanted copies. Anime Expo was not
in a position to offer copies, but the various fansub
groups made it known through word-of-mouth that
they would be more than happy to provide copies to
members of anime clubs. This action prompted the
overabundant formation of clubs in California, and
particularly in the San Francisco area: many people
formed clubs just to get access.
3.10.3. Fansubbing and its Causal Link to
Licensing
To understand the repercussions of fansubbing
on fandom and industry, consider the following cases.
For Anime Expo Åf93, Kiotsukete Studios67 subtitled all
six episodes of Tenchi Muyo!, all three at the time
existing episodes of Ah! My Goddess, Ranma ? Movie
2, two of the Gundam movies, Koko wa Greenwood,
and All-Purpose Cultural Cat Girl Nuku Nuku.
American companies licensed many of these titles
soon after Anime Expo Åf93: every single showing at
the convention was well-attended, and people wanted
to see the titles professionally released. Some of these
titles were already in discussion, but there were other
shows that no one in the industry had any interest in
whatsoever that got picked up later.
Whether or not these fansubs actually prompted
American companies to license these titles is a matter
of hot debate. However, the plain facts are that anime
companies in 1991 through 1993 licensed titles
circulating in the fansub community with far greater
frequency than non-fansubbed titles. If licensing of
these titles were mere coincidence, import houses
would have to have relied on the showÅfs popularity in
Japan to predict popularity with the American public.
If a causation link exists, it owes to the existing
popularity of anime among American fandom as
measured by attendance at conventions, proliferation
of clubs, consumption of fansubs, and motivations of
fan-oriented industrialists. We conclude the latter:
given the universe of potential Japanese to choose to
license, and the still-limited appeal of anime in the
American public, early anime companies had to rely
on the existing fan base, and had to grow that fan base,
if they were to turn a profit. That fan base relied on
the circulation of fansubs. Conceptually, the
proselytization commons shaped the commercial
enterprise, not the other way around. We cite one
example, and then revisit this argument in the
following subsection, ÅgIndustryÅh (page 24).
Consider Koko wa Greenwood (also Here is
Greenwood), which Software Sculptors licensed in
1996.68 Koko wa Greenwood was first issued as a girlsÅf
manga; it had no following in Japan outside of teenage
girls who were following the manga, and those girls
hated the more boy-oriented anime! When Kiotsukete
Studios fansubbed it, they thought it was quirky, yet
incredibly funny. However, when Kiotsukete started
distributing Greenwood, no one wanted it; Kiotsukete
had to include it as an extra episode at the end of a
tape just to get people interested in it, because those
people had heard so many things about it being a
girlsÅf manga. After people started watching
Greenwood,69 demand grew, and the property became
valuable enough to license. Koko wa Greenwood
turned out to be a lifesaver for Software Sculptors,
because up to that point they really had not released
anything that was really worth having, and their sales
figures bore this out. Koko wa Greenwood was a
pleasant six-episode animation that everybody liked. 3.10. Conventions 9/12/2004
Version 1.11-columnar Progress Against the Law Page 22 of 39
People went out and bought it; they were no longer
available from the fansubbing source because
Kiotsukete, the only group to fansub Greenwood in its
entirety, stopped releasing it and told its distributors
to stop distributing it.
3.10.4. Fansubbing vis-a-vis Bootlegging
Anime Expo Åf93 was also the first instance at
which American industry representatives started
talking more publicly about pre-existing copies eating
into profits. Many of the shows from Anime Expo Åf92,
for example, were starting to come out commercially,
and people were starting to buy them in 1993. At that
time, Jackson and other attendees started to hear
gossip from the industry that bootleggers, as they
called them, were eating into their profits, and that
something had to be done about it.

Table 1: Categories and distinctions between fansubs
and bootlegs.
We carefully note the distinction between
fansubs and bootlegs, summarized in Table A.
FansubbersÅf stated intent was to spread the awareness
of Japanese animation: although they have been
accused of merely Ågpreaching to the convertedÅh (e.g.,
by Carl Macek and Jerry Beck),70 evidence throughout
this section suggests that fansubbers successfully
introduced the post-Akira generation to the diversity
that the medium offered. From their earliest days,
fansubbers would remove their titles from circulation
once they were licensed in the United States.71 In all
but the earliest fansubs, fansubbers would add
subtitles like ÅgNot for Sale or RentÅh and ÅgStop
Distribution When LicensedÅh in addition to their
fansub group name; they would also encourage
fansub viewers to purchase the licensed product once
it was made available. William ChowÅfs tapes went so
far as to include these warnings during character
dialogue, which some fans reported as annoying.
Bootleggers, however, were only interested in
making a profit at the industryÅfs expense. To the
industryÅfs credit, vendors had every right to believe
that bootleggers were eating into profits, because
there were unscrupulous enterprises that would go
out and bootleg material?even fansubs?in order to
sell them at sci-fi and anime conventions where they
would market themselves as if they were an anime
club. Perhaps the most famous bootleggers of the time
were known by their pseudonyms S. Baldric and E.
Monsoon.72 Kiotsukete would of course happily
duplicate tapes for such bootleggers, and then the
bootleggers would go in and erase the segment of the
tape where it said, ÅgNot for Sale or for Rent,Åh which
Kiotsukete put at the beginning and end of every
episode on every tape. Once Kiotsukete members
started seeing bootleggers hawking their material at
conventions, they became more restrictive when
distributing to other groups. By 1995, Kiotsukete set a
quota on copies made, and required that people prove
that they were members of anime clubs. As
technology advanced, Kiotsukete developed
watermarking, overlays, and commercial spots
between the breaks to better identify the group and to
increase the barrier that bootleggers had to cross in
order to duplicate KiotsuketeÅfs work.
3.10.5. Preparation, Distribution, and
Exhibition of Fansubs
Kiotsukete seems to be the only group that
placed such extreme restrictions on distribution, but
all known fansubbing groups upheld the basic
principle of ÅgNot for Sale or for Rent.Åh Neither
fansubbers nor bootleggers, however, had a license for
the anime works with which they were dealing. In
certain limited cases, such as KiotsuketeÅfs, a license
was obtained for screening at an anime convention.
Even then, not all fansubbed materials were licensed
at the earliest conventions. As Jackson explained, 3.10. Conventions 9/12/2004
Version 1.11-columnar Progress Against the Law Page 23 of 39
fansub groups during the 1989 through 1993 period
worked under the philosophy of, Ågwe only subtitle
things that we know have not been picked up. If it has
been picked up, we will not touch it.Åh If a company did
not announce that it had acquired the rights to a show,
a fansub group generally reasoned: Ågwell, they did not
tell us, and we can claim ignorance on this, and until
it is made publicly known, we will continue to subtitle
it and distribute it.Åh
Recent evidence suggests that members of the
Ranma Project operated along a slightly different line
of thought. They liked Ranma ? a lot, and they
wanted everybody to be able to watch it. They
thought that there was no way it would ever be
licensed in America given that the select few anime
licensed in America were of the mecha (giant robot)
genre, or were grotesquely mutilated when localized.
Consequently, Ranma Project members decided to
subtitle and distribute as much of it as they could in
order to show everyone how interesting it was. Once
it became known that Viz Communications planned
on licensing Ranma ?,73 they stopped everything cold.
They stopped cold not only because of legal concerns,
but because, in the very tight community around San
Jose, everyone in the anime field knew each other.
Everybody knew Trish Ledoux and Toshi Yoshida of
Viz. Fansubbers would have good reason to remember
them, in any case, from Ledoux and YoshidaÅfs days at
Animag. As Jackson reported no more plainly, Åg[ItÅfs]
because we have to go to Viz, and we have to go to
functions, and theyÅfre there, and weÅfre there, and it
would be a lot more trouble than itÅfs worth. So, thatÅfs
why a lot of people were like, Åeokay, Trish Ledoux and
Toshi Yoshida are our friends, so we arenÅft going to do
this to them to make their lives miserable.ÅfÅh
The strong connections between fandom and
industry can also be seen in the case of Kiotsukete
Studios, most of whom staffed the programming
crews of major conventions at the time. Japanese
companies knew that convention in-house staff
would prepare subtitles with their permissions, but it
was not made explicit what would happen to those
subtitled versions auxiliary to the convention.
Without exception, if an American company owned a
title, Kiotsukete would not distribute it. If a subtitled
version of an unlicensed title happened to exist in the
aftermath of a convention, however, Kiotsukete would
almost certainly send copies to those who asked.
ÅgInitial distributionÅh in KiotsuketeÅfs case consisted of
two men with four professional series S-Deck VCRs
making copies for everybody, but they would copy
and distribute in their leisure time. Once it became
known that an American company had licensed a
show, they completely stopped filling requests for that
title.
Whereas fansubbers always stopped sharing
after a title was licensed, distributors acted
inconsistently. Certain histories have lumped
fansubbers and distributors together as Ågtape-traders,Åh
a term that simplifies the complexities of the period.74
Unlike fansubbers, some distributors continued
distributing tapes. (Contrary to popular belief,
however, William Chow seems to have followed the
Ågcease-after-licenseÅh protocol.)75 Furthermore, other
groups would use other fansubbed tapes as trade bait,
which continued the propagation of material. One
anime club president, for example, attested that
during his early days as a member he had to Ågamass a
large enough collection [of anime material] copied
from the club library in order to have enough
interesting stuff to trade with others.Åh
Fansubs might also be shown at anime clubs
after they had been licensed. Another member of
Kiotsukete, who was also an officer at a local fan club
in 1993, reported that there were Åga lot of times
[when] we would subtitle a show just because we
wanted to screen it for our clubs, and to that end,
there were a lot of times when we did that, but we did
not distribute it.Åh For example, local anime clubs
connected to Kiotsukete had already screened several
fansubbed Ah! My Goddess episodes when AnimEigo
announced that Ah! My Goddess would be
commercially released the following year. After the
announcement, Kiotsukete subtitled episodes 5 and 6
and screened them at its affiliated clubs, but did not
distribute the episodes to larger fan distributors.
Kiotsukete-connected clubs even let companies like
AnimEigo know that they were going to screen the
anime Ågfor them.Åh
Despite these copyright-infringing activities, it is
important to draw the distinction between fansubbers,
distributors, and clubs with respect to the preparation,
propagation, and exhibition of tapes. Companies were
definitely unhappy about these incidents, but the
Kiotsukete member pointed out that the prevailing
motivation was to get more people interested in the
animation itself. No fansubber made a profit off of his
or her work. There were some fansubbers who
obtained jobs in the domestic industry because of the
work that they did, but that is more a testament to the 3.11. Industry 9/12/2004
Version 1.11-columnar Progress Against the Law Page 24 of 39
quality of their work. For some, fansubbing was their
only way of showing the industry that they had the
ability to work.
Most fansubbers subtitled because they loved
anime. The member concluded, ÅgI did it because I
wanted to see more anime [everywhere]. I wanted to
see more people enjoy Japanese animation, and to that
end, that was my goal, and I think that I have been
pretty successful with it.Åh
3.11. Industry
In this subsection we consider the development
of four major American importers: A.D. Vision (now
ADV Films), AnimEigo, Streamline Pictures, and
Pioneer LDC. As the reader shall see, in all four cases
the fan culture played a pivotal role in each companyÅfs
formation and initial operation, although the
circumstances are unique to each company.
3.11.1. A.D. Vision
John Ledford and Matt Greenfield met while
both were working for businesses that rented and sold
anime laserdiscs.76 Ledford and Greenfield also ran a
Houston-based animation club in 1992, during
which?through the fan network?they met with
several others who were working in the manga
industry in Japan, including Toren Smith. These
artists pointed out that nothing forbade Ledford and
Greenfield from going to Japan, licensing titles, and
bringing them back to America. Realizing that both
Ledford and Greenfield had identical visions for
anime in America, they chose to do just that. John
Ledford had accumulated some savings, and
Greenfield had been going to film school. They
decided to form A.D. Vision, after which they went to
Japan, talked to studio representatives, and convinced
them to license A.D. VisionÅfs first anime, Battle Angel.
After subtitling Battle Angel, Greenfield and
Ledford staged their first preorder at Anime America
in 1993. They made the announcement on Friday,
June 26, and on Saturday they opened up their booth
table to a horde of excited anime fans. A.D. Vision
continued to release a number of successful titles; in
2002 and 2003, Ledford was twice named as one of
ÅgThe 100 Most Powerful People in Genre
Entertainment.Åh77 Significantly, A.D. Vision got its
start in the fan network, and depended upon it for its
initial sales. Indeed, ADV followed StreamlineÅfs model
of releasing English dubs after it noticed that
StreamlineÅfs per-title sales far outstripped ADVÅfs
subtitled releases. Without the fan network, however,
ADV would have had no market base whatsoever.
3.11.2. AnimEigo
The history of AnimEigo is well-documented,78
so we do not recount it in its entirety here. Although
CEO Robert Woodhead is not a fan per se, the history
of the company is very connected with organized
fandom. Co-founder Roe Adams was a huge anime
fan; he was seen regularly during the early years of the
Cornell Japanese Animation Society in 1988.
Significantly, the first post by AnimEigo on Usenet
claims that ÅgAnimEigo is a cooperative venture of
Anime fans.Åh79 Without the fan network and exposure
to existing, unreleased Japanese animation, it is
unlikely that AnimEigo would have started.
3.11.3. Streamline Pictures
In 1986, while Carl Macek was producing
Robotech the Movie, he got together with Jerry Beck.
Beck?quite well-regarded in the American
animation field?was also an anime fan; he ran the
New York chapter of the Cartoon/Fantasy
Organization during the early 1980s before he moved
out to Los Angeles. Both Macek and Beck were aware
of this potential market on a very personal level. If no
one was taking advantage of it, they reasoned, they
decided that they might as well. They started
Streamline pictures in 1988 with their release of Akira
(1989), followed by a slew of titles that typified anime
available in the early 1990s.
Fred Patten knew Macek from the early 1980s,
when Patten was one of the fans who attended anime
screenings at MacekÅfs shop. Patten would later
interview Macek for articles in the American fanzines
Amazing Heroes and Comics Journal. They were
reasonably close acquaintances at that time, so when
Macek and Beck started up Streamline Pictures,
Patten offered his services and advice, since Patten
was in favor of anything that would promote anime in
America. Macek and Beck would regularly ask Patten
about what the most popular titles with fans were, and
what the main Japanese studios of those titles were, so
that they could decide whether or not they wanted to
try and license those titles. After Patten lost his job as
a technical librarian for Hughes Aircraft Company,
Mack and Beck invited him to join Streamline
Pictures; like so many others, in 1990 Patten turned
his hobby into a profession. Patten was aware of
StreamlineÅfs activities on a very personal basis in the 3.11. Industry 9/12/2004
Version 1.11-columnar Progress Against the Law Page 25 of 39
early 90s, and he kept abreast of the other anime
companies starting up at the time.
Streamline was the center of attention in the
Ågdub-versus-subÅh debate, a heated multi-year
argument among fans over whether anime videos
should be dubbed or subtitled. Many of the early fans
in the days of the first licensed videos, that is, 1989-
1993 (indeed, dub-versus-sub arguments continued
through 1999), felt that videos should be subtitled.
Subtitling was much cheaper than dubbing the videos,
and the videos tended to have higher translation
quality because the voice talent doing the dubbing
was generally not that good. Streamline Pictures,
however, made a point of only dubbing. As Macek and
Beck contended, most of the general public would not
take the trouble to read subtitled videos.80 They
argued that the public wanted to hear spoken
dialogue even if the voice quality was not very high.
Neither Patten nor we agree with the second
point, but Macek and Beck were absolutely correct on
the first. Due to the long history of high-quality and
abundant English-language programming in the
United States, the American public remains reluctant
to go to the trouble of watching a subtitled video or
movie. If the goal of an anime company was to
publicize or promote anime to the public, then
dubbing was a necessity; as Macek stated, ÅgThe whole
goal of Streamline was to bring anime to a broad
audience.Åh81 By 1993, StreamlineÅfs tapes were selling so
much better than other companiesÅf that the other
companies?A.D. Vision and US Manga Corps. in
particular?realized that if their main goal was to
make money, then they needed to go to the expense of
dubbing rather than subtitling everything.
Dubbing turned out to be less of a concern in
the long run than maintaining the fidelity of the story
in the original animation. Once dubbing was
decoupled from the hack-and-slash methods of anime
importation in the 1980s, fan furor slowly receded
and sales rapidly increased. One of PattenÅfs main
duties at Streamline Pictures was to verify the
accuracy of the materials that Streamline received
when they licensed a title, because Streamline tried to
emphasize was that they were faithfully translating
the original Japanese. These materials included the
negatives, sound effects, and raw translations of
Japanese scripts that Patten and others would then
rewrite into smooth English: Streamline workers
would adjust the language to match mouth
movements and other audiovisual cues. The Japanese
industry was so used to the Americans completely
rewriting everything, however, that they tended to
send over very sloppy translations. For instance,
instead of naming the characters, they would call
them Man A, Man B, and Man C. Worse yet, they
would just give the characters American names like
Charlie and Joe, so that American producers could
rename them as Pete, Bob, or whatever struck their
fancy. One of PattenÅfs many jobs, then, was to research
and reinstate original character names.
As we have seen, Streamline Pictures was
intimately connected with the fandom. While
Streamline purported that it wanted to attract a broad
audience, it also attempted to remain faithful to the
original Japanese stories. This idea was deeply rooted
in the fandom, and led to StreamlineÅfs early success.
3.11.4. Pioneer LDC
A branch of the much larger LaserDisc
Corporation of America, in turn owned by Pioneer
Corporation of Japan, Pioneer Animation was the first
Japanese company to enter the American anime
industry, announcing its entrance on April 21, 1993.82
PioneerÅfs first projects were Tenchi Muyo! and
Moldiver, both of which the company released on
laserdisc and VHS. Before releasing these titles,
however, they made themselves highly visible at
Anime Expo Åf93 to show off their wares, and have
continued to attend Anime Expo ever since.
It remains unclear that the presence and success
of Tenchi Muyo! fansubs directly motivated Pioneer to
enter the market. It is clear, however, that they saw
enough profit in the field to justify entering in 1993,
thanks in part to the fan base. PioneerÅfs Tenchi Muyo!
OVA releases became standards in the industry, and
with PioneerÅfs commitment to high-quality anime on
Laserdisc, their releases quickly landed on the Ågmust
seeÅh lists of most fans.83 In his second letter to anime
fans, David Wallace, Marketing Manager at Pioneer,
wrote: ÅgIs Pioneer creating this product for the fans or
for a larger audience? / We are trying to reach the
broadest audience for this product. Maybe we are
trying too much, but, we think we can succeed and
satisfy the [anime fans (lit. hotaku(sic))] and also
reach a more general audience.Åh84 We conclude that,
like Streamline Pictures, Pioneer entered the
American anime industry with intent to grow the
market, but also with a reliance on the existing fan
base and its established preferences. 3.12. Success Returns to Japan 9/12/2004
Version 1.11-columnar Progress Against the Law Page 26 of 39
3.12. Success Returns to Japan
As the earliest evidence from the Ranma Project
suggests, many Japanese companies were aware of fan
subtitling, just as some had been aware of fan
distribution in 1978. They were not aware, however, to
the extent that fan distribution played in developing a
sustainable, growing interest in anime consumption.
Rational ignorance explains their motivations in part:
Japanese companies really did not care much about
this market, as confirmed throughout interviews
during this study. The American market meant almost
nothing to them up through 1993. This sentiment is
no longer true, because there is a tremendous amount
of money to be made in America. During 1976-1993,
however, Japanese companies did not think that they
would be able to sell much to America in terms of
entertainment goods. America was always the market
that every international industry wanted to enter, but
Hollywood entertainment establishments like Warner
Bros. and Disney continually denied the Japanese
entrance. In almost all cases, Japanese companies were
either ignored, e.g., Warner Bros. failure to attend
screenings between 1978-1982, refused, e.g., the
sentiment that, Ågwell, weÅfre selling cartoons, and weÅfve
always been told by the Disney people that our shows
will never sell in America,Åh or in one case, plagiarized,
e.g., the infamous Kimba/Simba case,85 the details of
which are inappropriate for this study.
Up through 1993, the buck stopped in Japan
both literally and metaphorically. Properties might go
to Taiwan or the Philippines; if it went to China, it was
more often than not on a Ågpirate shipÅh or through a
tape dungeon. The Japanese never expected, however,
that anime would become popular in America.
AnimEigoÅfs first licensor, for example, was shocked
when AnimEigo wrote them a check for additional
royalties: the licensor did not expect additional
royalties! Kenichi Sonoda was equally surprised when
Renault told him in the late 1980s that he had a friend
in America who knew Bubblegum Crisis, Ågand really
thinks it is one of the greatest shows he has ever seen.Åh
Isao TakahataÅfs reaction was mentioned previously.
Before he came out to Anime America Åf94, Go Nagai,
the boundary-pushing artist behind Cutey Honey, was
amazed when he received tapes of works airing on
American MTV that year. The tapes included
Tatsunoko ProductionsÅf Mach Go Go Go (Speed
Racer), as well as an MTV special on NagaiÅfs work.
Nagai did not realize the following that anime had in
America up to that time. He discovered, for example,
that while Mach Go Go Go (Speed Racer) was
regarded among a small following in Japan, in
America many still regarded Mach Go Go Go as a cult
classic. Even Monkey Punch (Lupin III) is still thrilled
when older anime fans, people closer to his age, come
up to him to talk to him about the original TV series:
it amazes him that people were able to get access to
those shows, considering that they were not aimed at
the American market in any way, shape, or form.
Without the fan network, and specifically without fan
distribution, none of these activities could have ever
happened.
3.13. Concluding the Historical
Analysis
Fan distribution began as early as technology
enabled it in 1976. Anime fandom grew out of
science-fiction fandom, but quickly evolved a
character of its own. The Japanese were unsuccessful
in entering the American market on their terms, so
they abandoned it, turning a blind eye to it for a full
decade. American anime fandom grew throughout
the 1980s until it became a powerhouse for
underground distribution in the absence of copyright
regulation. The few attempts at promoting anime in
the 1980s to the mainstream grew directly out of this
fandom. While unsuccessful in establishing a
permanent trend, these attempts brought with them a
small wake of new anime fans who quickly integrated
into the fan network. The fan network, which ran on
massively distributed, untranslated anime, became a
closed proselytization commons that catalyzed interest
in unadulterated anime in the late 1980s.
Fansubbing and domestic industry essentially
began at the same time with the advance of
technology. Both grew out of the fanatical desire to
proselytize anime, although the latter saw neglected
profits in animeÅfs commercialization, based off of
experience in the fan distribution network.
Fansubbing from 1989 through 1993 too served a
commercial benefit in exposing a new generation of
fans to new anime, especially anime that did not fit
the boysÅf/mecha mold. Furthermore, fansubbing
shaped expectations of anime that directly led to
animeÅfs commercialization. The distribution network
under fansubbing became an open proselytization
commons, and with it came a strong desire to support
the nascent anime industry based on an economically
undiscounted future. Without fan distribution, the fan
network, the domestic industry, and thus the anime 3.13. Concluding the Historical Analysis 9/12/2004

4. Legal Analysis of Fan Distribution and Subtitling 9/12/2004
Version 1.11-columnar Progress Against the Law Page 30 of 39
4. Legal Analysis of Fan
Distribution and Subtitling
Our analysis turns to the legal implications of
the fan distribution network between 1976-1993. We
will draw from American copyright law circa 1976-
1993,86 Japanese copyright law circa 1976-1993,87 and
relevant international treaties, i.e., the Universal
Copyright Convention as amended in 197188 and the
Berne Convention as amended in 1971,89 to which the
United States acceded in 1989. The reader may
strongly suspect that fan distribution was illegal
according to these laws. We conclude that it was, and
show specifically what sections these practices violate.
We further exhaust possible avenues for exceptions
and fair use, showing that fans were left with no
recourse but to commit copyright infringement on a
wide scale. If the outcome of this fan distribution was
desirable in the long run, therefore, the law did not
sanction it at any point.
4.1. Basics of International
Copyright Law
First and foremost, there is no such thing as
universal copyright for a work of authorship. As
copyright is a bundle of intangible property rights
created entirely by the law, extension of copyright
depends on laws that govern individual countries.
Because our concern is copyright extension and
enforcement in the United States, this analysis focuses
on the laws and regulations of the United States in
regard to animations as audiovisual works.
In the United States, copyright subsists Ågin
original works of authorship fixed in any tangible
medium of expression,Åh including Ågmotion pictures
and other audiovisual works,Åh 17 U.S.C. Åò 102 (2003).
Works?particularly anime?are subject to protection
if Ågon the date of first publication, one or more of the
authors is a national or domiciliary of the United
States, or is a national, domiciliary, or sovereign
authority of a treaty party, [Åc] or the work is first
published in the United States or in a foreign nation
that, on the date of first publication, is a treaty party,Åh
17 U.S.C. Åò 104(b) (2003).
The fulfillment of 17 U.S.C. Åò 104(b), for our
purposes, rests on two international treaties: the
Universal Copyright Convention (hereafter ÅgUCCÅh)
and the Berne Convention for the Protection of
Literary and Artistic Works (hereafter ÅgBerneÅh). The
United States acceded to the former in 1952 and to
the latter in 1989. Japan acceded to UCC on April 28,
1956, and to Berne on July 15, 1899; therefore, these
treaties both circumscribe the copyrights of Japanese
nationals outside of Japan. According to the UCC,
ÅgPublished works of nationals of any Contracting
State and works first published in that State shall
enjoy in each other Contracting State the same
protection as that other State accords to works of its
nationals first published in its own territory, as well as
the protection specially granted by this Convention,Åh
Universal Copyright Convention, July 24, 1971, art.
II(1). Berne states, ÅgAuthors shall enjoy, in respect of
works for which they are protected under this
Convention, in countries of the Union other than the
country of origin, the rights which their respective
laws do now or may hereafter grant to their nationals,
as well as the rights specially granted by this
Convention,Åh Berne Convention for the Protection of
Literary and Artistic Works, July 24, 1971, art. V(1).
Essentially, under the UCC, works of authorship
that are granted copyright in Japan are also granted
copyright in the United States. In the case of Berne,
copyright is upheld among all States in the Berne
Union. However, neither the UCC nor Berne are selfexecuting
in the United States, meaning the
provisions of UCC and Berne do not apply
automatically, see 17 U.S.C. Åò 104(c) (2003). Instead,
17 U.S.C. Åò 104 provides the same requirements for
copyrighted works as UCC and Berne. The effect is
transparent, except in cases where Berne is amended
by its treaty parties without the consent of the United
States, which has not happened since the US joined
Berne in 1989. Both UCC and Berne contain language
relating to exceptional cases for translations of
copyrighted works, which we will revisit in a
subsequent subsection. For purposes of this analysis,
however, the effects of UCC and Berne place rights
conferred upon anime as the exclusive province of US
law.
4.2. Copyright in Japanese
Animated Works in Japan
Japanese copyright law differs in certain respects
from American copyright law. In ÅgPurpose,Åh the
Japanese Copyright Law (hereafter JCL) asserts: 4.2. Copyright in Japanese Animated Works in Japan 9/12/2004
Version 1.11-columnar Progress Against the Law Page 31 of 39
ÅgThe purpose of this Law is, by
providing for the rights of authors
and the rights neighboring thereon
with respect to works as well as
performances, phonograms,
broadcasts and wire diffusions, to
secure the protection of the rights
of authors, etc., having regard to a
just and fair exploitation of these
cultural products, and thereby to
contribute to the development of
culture.Åh
We consider the implications of Japanese copyright
law in this subsection.
4.2.1. What Is Owned and Who Owns It
Japanese law qualifies Ågworks,Åh including
Ågcinematographic works,Åh as valid for protection, JCL
2 Åò 1 art. 10. Cinematographic works are eligible for
copyright for seventy years, JCL 2 Åò 4 art. 54. Works
must be authored by Japanese nationals, or must be
first published in Japan, JCL 1 Åò 2 art. 6. Two classes of
protection exist in Japanese law: moral rights, and
copyrights.
Moral rights are inalienable, and are conferred
upon the original authors of a cinematographic work
Ågattributed to those who, by taking charge of
producing, directing, filming, art direction, etc., have
contributed to the creation of that work as a whole,
excluding authors of novels, scenarios, music or other
works adapted or reproduced in that work,Åh JCL 2 Åò 2
art. 16. This definition of cinematographic authorship
only holds if Article 15 does not apply, i.e., the work is
not a work for hire.
Copyright in a cinematographic work belongs to
Ågthe maker of that work, provided that the authors of
the work have undertaken to participate in the
making thereof,Åh JCL 2 Åò 3(4) art. 29(1). ÅgMakers of
cinematographic worksÅh refers to Ågthose who take the
initiative in, and the responsibility for, the making of a
cinematographic work,Åh JCL 1 Åò 1 art. 2(1)(x). Because
neighboring rights in Japanese copyright law provide
particular rights to broadcasters, broadcasters
frequently invest in the work to become Ågmakers.Åh In
practice, JCL motivates several classes of companies
to become copyright holders: distribution houses,
derivative-works companies such as toymakers, and
production companies. Production companies, of
course, take charge of authoring the work, i.e., the
production company vested with authorship is the
company where the producer, director, and subdirectors
work. Subcontracting occurs frequently in
the anime industry; indeed, it is rare for a large
project to not have multiple studios working on it at
the same time. However, if a production company
subcontracts some work out to another production
company, then the subcontracted company rarely
owns joint copyright in the work.
4.2.2. Domestic and International Rights of
These Owners
Because Japanese domestic rights are relevant to
our study for the purpose of comparison with
American rights, we briefly list them. JCL 2 Åò 2 arts.
18-20 cover the three moral rights: Ågmaking the work
public,Åh Ågdetermining the indication of the authorÅfs
name,Åh and Ågpreserving the integrity.Åh The eleven
major rights under copyrights, JCL 2 Åò 3 arts. 21-28,
cover the rights of reproduction, of performance, of
presentation, Ågof public transmission, etc.,Åh of
recitation, of exhibition, of distribution, of transfer of
ownership, of lending, Ågof translation, adaptation, etc.,Åh
and Ågof the original author in exploitation of a
derivative work.Åh The last right is particularly curious:
the copyrights, though not the moral rights, of an
author extend to derivative works made with his or
her original work, JCL 2 Åò 3(3) art. 28.
Neighboring rights exist in Japanese copyright
law: these rights are granted to those who
communicate works to the public, even though these
groups do not create works per se. Broadcasters have
neighboring rights as relates to anime: in particular,
rights of fixation, of photographing, of reproduction,
Ågof making available,Åh of retransmission, and Ågof
communication to the public by enlarging devices,Åh
JCL 4 Åò 4 arts. 98-100. That these rights overlap with
the rights of authors explains much about the coownership
of anime titles.
Unlike American copyright law, Japanese
copyright law contains no general fair use provision.
Indeed, many have argued that the moral rights of
authors in Japanese copyright law form the exact
opposite of the fair use rights of the public in
American copyright law.90 Japanese law does, however,
contain a laundry list of limitations on copyright:
most notably, it permits reproduction for personal,
family, or Åglimited circleÅh use (called Ågprivate useÅh),
quotations (including pictorial quotations),
performances for non-profit functions, and
translations for certain classes of works. These
limitations are largely outside of the scope of this 4.3. Time-Shifting/Fan Recording from America 9/12/2004
Version 1.11-columnar Progress Against the Law Page 32 of 39
study: we apply the law as directly relates to uses in
the United States. Indeed, we are obliged to apply
American law to American fan distributors, because
United States law prevails in all cases where the
United States has original jurisdiction, because UCC
only specifies that Japanese works receive US
copyright protection, and because the Berne
Convention Implementation Act of 1988 states that
US obligations under the Berne Convention are
wholly satisfied by existing levels of domestic
protection, Pub. L. No. 100-568, 102 Stat. 2853 Åò 2.
Had we explained the legality of the following uses
wholly in terms of Japanese copyright law, this
analysis would have concluded very differently. This
analysis will, however, apply JCL as it may apply to
recordings extracted from Japan and sent to America.
The relations between anime copyright holders
and their American rights are simpler to describe.
Japanese animation owners retain all domestic rights
under United States copyright law according to U.S.C.
Title 17 Section 104. Their rights are enumerated in
U.S.C. Title 17 Section 106, ÅgExclusive rights in
copyrighted works,Åh and are limited by subsequent
sections 107-122. In particular, fair uses, if established,
do not constitute copyright infringement according to
17 U.S.C. Åò 107 (2003).
4.3. Time-Shifting/Fan Recording
from America
The first potential infringement raised in 1976
was the practice of time-shifting recordings from
Japanese community television in the United States.
For this analysis we assume that the Japanese
community TV stations secured licenses from Japan
for broadcast of this material. There are no known
court cases between Japanese license holders and
American community television stations. Although
we recognize that absence of evidence does not
preclude evidence of absence, there is no good reason
to believe that these television stations showed
unlicensed materials: they were visible enough in
America among broadcasters that, if companies like
Toei wanted to sue the stations while they had a
presence in the United States, they could have easily.
Sony v. Universal, 464 U.S. 417 (1983) clearly
dealt time-shifting broadcast works, i.e., recording
these works for home use. In it, the Supreme Court
ruled that time-shifting was a fair use, that the
practice carried no likelihood of non-minimal harm
to the potential market (as demonstrated by plaintiff
copyright holders), and that the sale of home video
tape recorders to the general public did not constitute
contributory infringement because of the significant
potential for non-infringing uses. We concur in
affirming the fair use of time-shifting American
broadcast anime for private, home use: this fan
practice does not constitute copyright infringement.
4.4. Sharing Among Friends
Lending videotapes to others is analogous to
lending books. According to the first sale doctrine, the
materials in which copyrighted works are fixed are
treated as property, and can be bought, sold, leased,
and rented without the permission of the copyright
holder. This doctrine is embodied in 17 U.S.C. Åò 202
(2003), Ågownership of a copyright, or of any of the
exclusive rights under a copyright, is distinct from
ownership of any material object in which the work is
embodied.Åh Private lending to friends and family has
long been held a fair use; in any case, Section 106(3)
does not apply because it specifies an exclusive right
Ågto distribute copies or phonorecords of the
copyrighted work to the publicÅh (emphasis added). We
hold that private sharing among friends, as fans did in
the early days, does not constitute infringement.
4.5. Showings at Clubs
Showing an anime at a club, whether recorded
from American television or not, constitutes a public
performance of a copyrighted work, 17 U.S.C. Åò
106(3). The most significant exemption in statute is
17 U.S.C. Åò 110(1), which states that, notwithstanding
Åò 106, Ågperformance or display of a work by
instructors or pupils in the course of face-to-face
teaching activities of a nonprofit educational
institutionÅh is not an infringement of copyright. We
have shown, however, that college-based anime clubs
did not start en masse until the late 1980s at the
earliest. Even then, college-based anime clubs would
probably not qualify under the strict language of
Ågface-to-face teaching activitiesÅh in Section 110.
Furthermore, anime clubs from the late 1970s knew
that they were in violation of the copyright ownerÅfs
rights: Toei, TMS, and Tatsunoko confronted them as
early as 1978, and refused to authorize their
screenings. We conclude that showings at early anime
clubs were in violation of copyright.
4.6. Copying and Sending Across Country 9/12/2004
Version 1.11-columnar Progress Against the Law Page 33 of 39
4.6. Copying and Sending Across
Country
Private distribution, we have argued, is not an
infringement of copyright. However, systematic
reproduction and distribution of complete tapes on
the scale that was being practiced in the late 1970s far
overstepped the bounds of a fair use defense.
Evidence shows that there was little or no economic
value to the tapes at this time. Nevertheless, fair use
does not rest solely on the determination of economic
value or harm. The level of distribution seen
throughout the C/FO by the early 1980s began to take
on the character of a multi-branch library system, but
evidence does not suggest that it became a fullfledged,
coordinated library system until well into the
1980s. Consequently, it would not fall under
ÅgLimitations on exclusive rights: Reproduction by
libraries and archives,Åh 17 U.S.C. Åò 108. We conclude,
therefore, that reproduction dissemination of anime
across the country in the late 1970s through early
1980s was illegal.
4.7. Pen Pals in Japan
Interestingly enough, the pen pal relationships
that C/FO members struck up in the early 1980s
became significant sources of untranslated anime. In
principle, a Japanese pen pal would be exercising his
legal right to Ågreproduce by himself a work forming
the subject matter of copyright [Åc] for the purpose of
his personal use, family use or other similar uses
within a limited circle (hereinafter referred to as
Åeprivate useÅf),Åh JCL 2 Åò 3(5) art. 30. This argument
follows a similar line of reasoning that d?jinshi, or
Japanese fan comic, authors would use in intervening
years to justify their practice of selling fan-comics
that bore uncanny resemblances to professional
characters. In the American anime fan case, the
aforementioned argument sounds tenable:
exportation is permitted in the country of origin, so
should not importation be permitted as well?
American copyright law is silent on the topic of
exports out of foreign countries, most likely because
such a law would be unenforceable outside of US
jurisdiction. 17 U.S.C. ÅòÅò 601-603, however, have
much to say on the subject of importation: most of it
is unlawful. Indeed:
Importation into the United States,
without the authority of the owner
of copyright under this title, of
copies or phonorecords of a work
that have been acquired outside the
United States is an infringement of
the exclusive right to distribute
copies or phonorecords under
section 106, actionable under
section 501. 17 U.S.C. Åò 602(a).
Even though exportation from Japan may be lawful,
importation is unlawful without permission of the
copyright holder: that right is granted to Japanese
animation copyright holders and domestic copyright
holders alike.
There are, however, three exceptions to 17 U.S.C.
Åò 602(a). Exception (a)(1) did not apply in this case,
although we will revisit it in a later section. We
consider exceptions (a)(2) and (a)(3):
(2) importation, for the private use
of the importer and not for
distribution, by any person with
respect to no more than one copy
or phonorecord of any one work at
any one time, or by any person
arriving from outside the United
States with respect to copies or
phonorecords forming part of such
person's personal baggage; or
(3) importation by or for an
organization operated for scholarly,
educational, or religious purposes
and not for private gain, with
respect to no more than one copy of
an audiovisual work solely for its
archival purposes, and no more
than five copies or phonorecords of
any other work for its library
lending or archival purposes, unless
the importation of such copies or
phonorecords is part of an activity
consisting of systematic
reproduction or distribution,
engaged in by such organization in
violation of the provisions of
section 108(g)(2).
Subsection (a)(2) almost legalizes the
importation, except for a significant catch:
importation must be for the private use of the 4.8. Renting at Mom and Pop Stores 9/12/2004
Version 1.11-columnar Progress Against the Law Page 34 of 39
importer, and not for distribution. Even though one
could argue that C/FOÅfs systematic library processes
were not fully established in the early 1980s, it is clear
that fans would distribute these tapes among one
another, ultimately forming long and widely-reaching
distribution chains. Compare these fan trades with
modern-day P2P sharing techniques. The distribution
mechanism of early fandom could not propagate
anime at the same speed or fidelity as modern-day
P2P, but it had the same global reach and
decentralized organization.
Furthermore, Subsection (a)(2)Åfs use of
ÅgdistributionÅh does not qualify itself with Ågpublic
distribution,Åh as does 17 U.S.C. Åò 106(3). Our analysis
reduces (a)(2) to two interpretations: in one
interpretation, (a)(2) bans Ågprivate and public
distribution,Åh while in another interpretation, (a)(2)
bans Ågpublic distribution,Åh employing the same
reading as 17 U.S.C. Åò 106(3). In the former
interpretation, fans would infringe because they
would eventually copy these videos for their friends.
In the latter interpretation, fans would infringe
because their friends or pen pals in the US were not
yet organized into a closed distribution system along
the lines of the C/FO. Therefore, these fans were
distributing to the public. Regarding importation via
personal baggage in the latter half of (a)(2), we note
that the first major fan trip to Japan occurred in 1986.
Fan Ågbinge buyingÅh on a Tokyo run became more
common for wealthy fans in the 1990s, but not in the
early 1980s. Consequently, the subsection cannot
apply.
Subsection (a)(3) likewise cannot apply because
records indicate that only one or two copies of a work
would be sent back to America, at which point the
copies would be used for more than ÅgsolelyÅh archival
or lending purposes. In any case, fansÅf processes were
systematic enough in our opinion?as seen by the
uniform degradation in tape quality and the common
cultural reference to Ågcomparing the quality of
tapesÅh?to disqualify them according to the latter half
of subsection (a)(3).
We conclude, therefore, that the process of
disseminating anime through Japanese pen pals was
unlawful in the United States, even if the initial
receipt of tapes from Japanese pen pals were legal.
4.8. Renting at Mom and Pop
Stores
The doctrine of first sale has some bearing in
regard to renting anime at ÅgMom and Pop storesÅh (see
page 14). If a title is legally imported into the United
States, then it follows that these store owners are
allowed to rent these tapes out just as American
chains can. This is only true if these titles entered
America with the authorization of the copyright
holders (unlikely), or if these titles entered the United
States via the importerÅfs personal baggage (very likely),
see 17 U.S.C. Åò 602(a). Trafficking by means of
personal baggage was common enough to be included
in American law, and reports from the period indicate
that baggage-importation was a widespread practice
among vendors of imported media.
Importing time-shifted copies of broadcasts
with intent to profit, however, violates both American
and Japanese law. First and foremost, creating timeshifted
copies of broadcasts with intent to profit
violates the broadcasterÅfs neighbor right of
reproduction, JCL 4 Åò 4 art. 98, and may violate the
copyright ownerÅfs right of reproduction, JCL 2 Åò 3(3)
art. 21. The limitation for Ågprivate use,Åh JCL 2 Åò 3(5)
art. 30, would clearly not apply because the use is not
of a private nature, even though the work is copied for
a family member. Japanese copyright limitation law
notwithstanding in the United States, a similar
provision applies according to the subsequent
subsection of the importation statute: ÅgIn a case where
the making of the copies or phonorecords would have
constituted an infringement of copyright if this title
had been applicable, their importation is prohibited,Åh
17 U.S.C. Åò 602(b) (2003). Such a reproduction with
intent to profit violates the exclusive rights of
reproduction and distribution embodied in Section
106; since these copies actually were created under
such circumstances, they are illegal.
In any case, copying and distributing these
works on a systematic basis, as fans did, would also
constitute a violation of the rights of reproduction
and distribution granted in the United States, 17
U.S.C. Åò 106. Renting videos from Mom and Pop
stores to disseminate in the fan community was illegal.
4.9. Recording Anime from Japan
and Sending Them to America
This analysis turns to fan activities in the midto-
late 1980s, when fans disseminated Japanese 4.9. Recording Anime from Japan and Sending Them to America 9/12/2004
Version 1.11-columnar Progress Against the Law Page 35 of 39
animation at a much more rapid pace throughout the
community.
Note an interesting provision of this case: US
military personnel performed a major role in the
reproduction and distribution effort. 17 U.S.C.
Section 602(a)(1) specifies an exemption, which
states:
[This subsection does not apply
to?] importation of copies or
phonorecords under the authority
or for the use of the Government of
the United States or of any State or
political subdivision of a State, but
not including copies or
phonorecords for use in schools, or
copies of any audiovisual work
imported for purposes other than
archival use.
Upon review of the evidence, we conclude that
the US military personnel who disseminated tapes
were note acting in an official capacity on behalf of
the government. A contrary argument could be made
based on the disseminatorsÅf significant use of military
resources. Disseminators employed the military mail
system, the consumables on base?evidence, see page
15, asserts that disseminators only used tapes that
were sold on base?and the military education that
they received. Nevertheless, evidence asserts that the
disseminators operated during their off-duty hours
and that they paid for all of their material resources
without direct reimbursement from the government.
The disseminators directed themselves; they did not
act under the authority of a commanding officer. We
note the irony that US military personnel, who were
still functioning in some official capacity by virtue of
being on base in Japan, aided and abetted a reverse
cultural imperialism.
However, there are extenuating circumstances in
this scenario. We consider the case where the
disseminators copied and sent Japanese videotapes
and laserdiscs to America. If these commerciallyreleased
products were copied on Japanese territory,
one could evoke a Ågprivate useÅh argument in favor of
their reproduction. As with the ÅgMom and Pop storeÅh
case, once these copied tapes entered US soil on the
military base, they would be infringing as per 17
U.S.C. Åò 602(a). Likewise, if an anime broadcast was
recorded on Japanese territory and brought onto the
military base, the recording would infringe the same
clause. If these commercially-released products were
copied on US territory, disseminators would clearly
infringe the exclusive right of reproduction in 17
U.S.C. Åò 106(1), although they would clear the
importation test. The case of an anime broadcast
intercepted and recorded on US military property is
much less clear. Let us assume that, like the
commercially-released product, the broadcast
recording is created without violating 17 U.S.C. Åò
602(a) for the only following reason: there is no
willful traversal of a countryÅfs borders with a
television show fixed in a tangible medium.
The latter two scenarios do not take into
consideration that C/FO Rising Sun was clearly part
of a nonprofit library operation, however. Assuming
that C/FO qualified as a nonprofit, educational and
publicly-accessible (that is, accessible with a uniform
membership fee) library, ÅgLimitations on exclusive
rights: Reproduction by libraries and archives,Åh 17
U.S.C. Åò 108, may justify the disseminatorsÅf actions.
Unfortunately, C/FO could not qualify for an
exemption under 17 U.S.C. Åò 108: it fails on many
counts. For example, it is clear that C/FO Rising Sun
made far more than one copy of each work that they
tried to obtain and distribute, 17 U.S.C. Åò 108(a). After
exhausting all of our possible scenarios that might
have justified anime recording in the eyes of the law,
we conclude that C/FO Rising SunÅfs recordings were
illegal.
That disseminatorsÅf actions were illegal may
have been obvious from the start, but additional
evidence suggests that the disseminators, like all other
importers of infringing goods, could have been
caught quite easily by the U.S. Customs Service.
Customs checks all mail?including APO mail?
entering the United States.91 Sections 602 and 603
state:
In either case, the Secretary of the
Treasury is authorized to prescribe,
by regulation, a procedure under
which any person claiming an
interest in the copyright in a
particular work may, upon payment
of a specified fee, be entitled to
notification by the Customs Service
of the importation of articles that
appear to be copies or
phonorecords of the work. 17 U.S.C.
Åò 602(b)
4.10. Translation 9/12/2004
Version 1.11-columnar Progress Against the Law Page 36 of 39
Articles imported in violation of
the importation prohibitions of this
title are subject to seizure and
forfeiture in the same manner as
property imported in violation of
the customs revenue laws. Forfeited
articles shall be destroyed as
directed by the Secretary of the
Treasury or the court, as the case
may be. 17 U.S.C. Åò 603(c)
Evidence again suggests that anime companies
systematically ignored the infringements that were
occurring as disseminators continued to import
anime illegally into the United States. In addition to
comments from Japanese companies up through the
early 1990s, U.S. Customs had no records on file of
anime companies that requested notification of
potentially infringing materials.
4.10. Translation
A translation is a quintessential example of a
derivative work, and derivative works fall under the
domain of copyright protection, 17 U.S.C. Åò 103.
Curiously, both UCC and Berne offer specific
guidelines for obtaining non-exclusive licenses to
prepare translations when an authorized translation
does not exist in a target language. The draconian
procedures required to obtain such a license include a
minimum three-year period after publication before
UCC or Berne would honor such a license.
This provision is moot, though: both treaties
specify that domestic law must establish the right to a
translation license; Title 17 of the United States Code
has never contained such a provision. Consequently,
fan translations are unlawfully prepared derivative
works. Because translations are wholly based on their
original works, no copyrights can subsist in them.
4.11. Fansubbing
The act of fansubbing during 1989-1993
combined translation, typesetting, and reproduction
onto a videotape, followed by an initial round of
distribution. As this analysis has shown, these
translation, reproduction, and distribution steps were
illegal. Therefore, the law prohibited fansubbing as
practiced between 1989 and 1993.
4.12. Distributing Fansubs Before
and After Licensing
During 1989-1993, fans quickly distinguished
between two periods for an anime product: the period
before a title was domestically licensed, and the
period after. From a legal standpoint, fansubs during
both periods were illegal. However, a fansub during
the latter period violates a domestic copyright of a
domestic licensee, rather than a domestic copyright of
an overseas owner. It is meaningless to say that a work
is Ågnot copyrightedÅh in the United States before it is
licensed, just as it is meaningless to say that a work
enjoys Ågcopyright throughout the world.Åh Rather,
adherence to international treaties guarantees that US
copyright in a Japanese animation exists in the United
States from the date of Japanese publication. The
commercial exploitation of an anime work does not
begin in the US, however, until the Japanese license
holder licenses one or more rights to a company that
will exploit the American market.
Japanese companies did not license these rights
en masse for over two decades until fans created their
own market through systematic violation of JapanÅfs
unexploited copyrights. This risk-taking by fans tells
much about the pivotal role of a proselytization
commons in the progress of the arts. Furthermore,
this analysis evinces how copyright law could have
obstructed that progress had any of copyrightÅfs
minutiae been enforced.
4.13. Before We Conclude
This analysis is not attempting to construct an
argument against the whole of international copyright
law. Copyrights, and international recognition of
copyrights, are invaluable in numerous cases.
International copyright recognition has been
instrumental to animeÅfs commercial success for Japan
as well as for America: every time this study uses
Åglicense,Åh the word signals a transfer of exclusive
rights between two countries, along with continual
transfers of capital and value. As one American
executive in the field said, Ågthe most effective
argument starts, ÅePay to the Order of.ÅfÅh Without
international copyrights, the anime market could not
have grown and capitalized as it has today.
But as valuable as copyrights have been in the
commercialization of anime, they also proved an
insurmountable barrier to entry. As important as
copyrights have been to growth of the present-day 4.14. Concluding the Legal Analysis 9/12/2004
Version 1.11-columnar Progress Against the Law Page 37 of 39
anime system, they equally hindered its creation.
Without the very real risk that fans took in their love
for the medium, anime would be far less popular and
profitable as it is today.
4.14. Concluding the Legal
Analysis
Fan distribution and fan subtitling as practiced
during 1976-1993, in virtually all of their
permutations, were illegal according to copyright law.
U.S. copyright law, by design or accident, presented
systematic barriers to entry for both fans and industry
alike. In violating the copyright law, fans took
substantial risks; these risks were mitigated by apathy
and indifference, not investment, encouragement, or
legal support, on the part of the Japanese.

Version 1.11-columnar Progress Against the Law Page 38 of 39
5. Progress Against the Law
Since the turn of the millennium, Japanese
animation has entered the mainstream in the US.
Spirited Away won an Academy Award, the Anime
Network took off in numerous markets, and Cartoon
Network pushed boundaries with ever-newer, avantgarde
anime on Adult Swim. Anime comprises an
estimated sixty percent of all broadcast animation
worldwide; in the United States, annual anime sales
totaled $500 million in 2002.92 At a Cambridge,
Massachusetts Suncoast?a metropolitan branch of a
nationwide retailer of videos?anime DVD sales
comprise more than twenty-five percent of the storeÅfs
total revenue.93
The medium has made almost unimaginable
strides in America over the past ten years. For that
dramatic growth, we have much to thank organized
fandom. Quite against the restrictions of copyright,
underground anime distribution flourished
throughout the 1980s and early 1990s to build a base
for a nascent domestic industry. Even fansubbing in
its earliest years turned more people into avid anime
enthusiasts and consumers, although the practice of
fansubbing became increasingly harder to justify. That
fans succeeded owes much to the apathy of foreign
copyright holders, but even more to fansÅf own tenacity.
Ironically, the least ÅgcreativeÅh of activities?as defined
by creation of original works of authorship?spawned
a proselytization commons that proved enormously
creative and profitable for all involved.
It remains to be seen whether the rise of
Japanese animation from the fandom represents an
anomaly or a basic economic principle guiding media
consumption. So much of this history, for example,
seems to be mere fortune and happenstance than a
reasoned and systematic development of a market.
Considering the barrier that copyright law presented
to fans, however, it is remarkable that the industrial
base grew as rapidly as it did. In a May 2003 statement
by the Development Bank of Japan, Hiroaki Yamato
writes:
Long ago, serious adult discussion
about anime was unheard of, but
now, even the economic media elite
is giving serious attention to the
issue. Long before the promotion of
Japanese intellectual property
became a big topic, copyright
royalties for Japanese animated
characters were already providing
substantial contribution towards
the lowering of JapanÅfs massive
deficit in service income.94
When a media revolution sparks a major economic
shift for a country, one wonders not only how the
revolution happened, but whether current conditions
permit a media success story like it to happen again.
The proselytization commons subsisted on violations
of copyright, yet proved creative, profitable, and
progressive. Paradoxically, we live in an age where
some media industries clamor for perfect control over
their copyrighted works. Where does the
contradiction lie: in the truth about the progress, or in
an assumption about the copyright?
The argument of this analysis is not against the
whole of copyright. We argue instead against an
incorrect inference: that progress of the arts and
development of culture require perfect control over
copyright. When copyright is relaxed in a nascent
market, development may be erratic, but it will
definitely not injure the progress of the arts. In at least
one case, it proved overwhelmingly successful.
