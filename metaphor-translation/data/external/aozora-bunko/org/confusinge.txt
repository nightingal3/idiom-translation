Confusing Words and Phrases that are Worth Avoiding - GNU Project - Free Software Foundation (FSF)Some 
Confusing or Loaded Words and Phrases that are Worth Avoiding
 [ Czech | English | French | Japanese | Polish | Portuguese | Russian | Spanish 
] 
There are a number of words and phrases which we recommend avoiding, or avoiding 
in certain contexts and usages. The reason is either that they are ambiguous, or 
that they imply an opinion that we hope you may not entirely agree with.

``BSD-style''
The expression ``BSD-style license'' leads to confusion because it lumps 
together licenses that have important differences. For instance, the original 
BSD license with the advertising clause is incompatible with the GNU GPL, but 
the revised BSD license is compatible with the GPL. 
To avoid confusion, it is best to name the specific license in question and 
avoid the vague term ``BSD-style.'' 
``Closed''
Describing non-free software as ``closed'' clearly refers to the term ``open 
source''. In the Free Software Movement, we want to avoid being confused with 
the more recent Open Source Movement, so we are careful to avoid usage that 
would encourage people to lump us in with them. Therefore, we avoid describing 
non-free software as ``closed''. We call it ``non-free'' or ``proprietary''. 
``Commercial''
Please don't use ``commercial'' as a synonym for ``non-free.'' That confuses two 
entirely different issues. 
A program is commercial if it is developed as a business activity. A commercial 
program can be free or non-free, depending on its license. Likewise, a program 
developed by a school or an individual can be free or non-free, depending on its 
license. The two questions, what sort of entity developed the program and what 
freedom its users have, are independent. 
In the first decade of the Free Software Movement, free software packages were 
almost always noncommercial; the components of the GNU/Linux operating system 
were developed by individuals or by nonprofit organizations such as the FSF and 
universities. But in the 90s, free commercial software started to appear. 
Free commercial software is a contribution to our community, so we should 
encourage it. But people who think that ``commercial'' means ``non-free'' will 
tend to think that the ``free commercial'' combination is self-contradictory, 
and dismiss the possibility. Let's be careful not to use the word ``commercial'' 
in that way. 
``Consumer''
The term "consumer", when used to refer to computer users, carries unfortunate 
assumptions. 
Economic theory uses the terms "producer" and "consumer". In that context these 
words are appropriate. But when people describe the users of software as 
"consumers", that assumes a narrow role for them. It assumes that the only role 
for people is as cattle that passively graze on what others make available to 
them. 
This kind of thinking leads to travesties like the CBDTPA "Consumer Broadband 
and Digital Television Promotion Act" which would require copying restriction 
facilities in every digital device. If all the users do is "consume", then why 
should they mind? 
The narrow economic vision of users as "consumers" tends to go hand in hand with 
the idea that published works are "content". 
To describe people who are not limited to passive consumption on their 
computers, we suggest terms such as "individuals" and "citizens". 
``Content''
If you want to describe a feeling of comfort and satisfaction, by all means say 
you are ``content'', but using it as a noun to describe written and other works 
of authorship is worth avoiding. That usage adopts a specific attitude towards 
those works: that they are an interchangeable commodity whose purpose is to fill 
a box and make money. In effect, it treats the works themselves with disrespect. 

Those who use this term are often the publishers that push for increased 
copyright power in the name of the authors (``creators'', as they say) of the 
works. The term ``content'' reveals what they really feel. 
As long as other people use the term ``content provider'', political dissidents 
can well call themselves ``malcontent providers''. 
``Creator''
The term ``creator'' as applied to authors implicitly compares them to a deity 
(``the creator''). The term is used by publishers to elevate the authors' moral 
stature above that of ordinary people, to justify increased copyright power that 
the publishers can exercise in the name of the authors. 
``Digital Rights Management''
``Digital Rights Management'' software is actually designed to impose 
restrictions on computer users. The use of the word ``rights'' in this term is 
propaganda, designed to lead you unawares into seeing the issue from the 
viewpoint of the few that impose the restrictions, while ignoring that of the 
many whom the restrictions are imposed on. 
Good alternatives include ``Digital Restrictions Management'' and 
``handcuffware.'' 
``For free''
If you want to say that a program is free software, please don't say that it is 
available ``for free.'' That term specifically means ``for zero price.'' Free 
software is a matter of freedom, not price. 
Free software copies are often available for free--for example, by downloading 
via FTP. But free software copies are also available for a price on CD-ROMs; 
meanwhile, proprietary software copies are occasionally available for free in 
promotions, and some proprietary packages are normally available at no charge to 
certain users. 
To avoid confusion, you can say that the program is available ``as free 
software.'' 
``Freeware''
Please don't use the term ``freeware'' as a synonym for ``free software.'' The 
term ``freeware'' was used often in the 1980s for programs released only as 
executables, with source code not available. Today it has no particular 
agreed-on definition. 
Also, if you use other languages than English, please try to avoid borrowing 
English words such as ``free software'' or ``freeware.'' Try to use the often 
less ambiguous wording that your language offers, e.g. 
  Arabic: Baramej Horrah 
  Chinese: zi4you2 ruan3jian4 
  Dutch: vrije software 
  Esperanto: libera programaro 
  French: logiciel libre 
  German: freie Software 
  Hebrew: tochna hofshit 
  Italian: software libero 
  Japanese: jiyuu [na] sofuto 
  Portuguese: software [programa] livre 
  Russian: svobodny programy 
  Slovak : slobodny' softve'r 
  Slovenian: prosto programje 
  Spanish : Software [programa] libre 
  Swedish: fri programvara 
  Tamil: Viduthalai 
  Turkish : &otilde;zg&uuml;r yazilim 
By forming a word in your own language, you show that you are really referring 
to freedom and not just parroting some mysterious foreign marketing concept. The 
reference to freedom may at first seem strange or disturbing to your countrymen, 
but once they see that it means exactly what it says, they will really 
understand what the issue is. 
``Give away software''
It's misleading to use the term ``give away'' to mean ``distribute a program as 
free software.'' It has the same problem as ``for free'': it implies the issue 
is price, not freedom. One way to avoid the confusion is to say ``release as 
free software.'' 
``Intellectual property''
Publishers and lawyers like to describe copyright as ``intellectual 
property''---a term that also includes patents, trademarks, and other more 
obscure areas of law. These laws have so little in common, and differ so much, 
that it is ill-advised to generalize about them. It is best to talk specifically 
about ``copyright,'' or about ``patents,'' or about ``trademarks.'' 
The term ``intellectual property'' carries a hidden assumption---that the way to 
think about all these disparate issues is based on an analogy with physical 
objects, and our ideas of physical property. 
When it comes to copying, this analogy disregards the crucial difference between 
material objects and information: information can be copied and shared almost 
effortlessly, while material objects can't be. Basing your thinking on this 
analogy is tantamount to ignoring that difference. (Even the US legal system 
does not entirely accept the analogy, since it does not treat copyrights or 
patents like physical object property rights.) 
If you don't want to limit yourself to this way of thinking, it is best to avoid 
using the term ``intellectual property'' in your words and thoughts. 
``Intellectual property'' is also an unwise generalization. The term is a 
catch-all that lumps together several disparate legal systems, including 
copyright, patents, trademarks, and others, which have very little in common. 
These systems of law originated separately, cover different activities, operate 
in different ways, and raise different public policy issues. If you learn a fact 
about copyright law, you would do well to assume it does not apply to patent 
law, since that is almost always so. 
Since these laws are so different, the term ``intellectual property'' is an 
invitation to simplistic thinking. It leads people to focus on the meager common 
aspect of these disparate laws, which is that they establish monopolies that can 
be bought and sold, and ignore their substance--the different restrictions they 
place on the public and the different consequences that result. At that broad 
level, you can't even see the specific public policy issues raised by copyright 
law, or the different issues raised by patent law, or any of the others. Thus, 
any opinion about ``intellectual property'' is almost surely foolish. 
If you want to think clearly about the issues raised by patents, copyrights and 
trademarks, or even learn what these laws require, the first step is to forget 
that you ever heard the term ``intellectual property'' and treat them as 
unrelated subjects. To give clear information and encourage clear thinking, 
never speak or write about ``intellectual property''; instead, present the topic 
as copyright, patents, or whichever specific law you are discussing. 
According to Professor Mark Lemley of the University of Texas Law School, the 
widespread use of term "intellectual property" is a recent fad, arising from the 
1967 founding of the World Intellectual Property Organization. (See footnote 123 
in his March 1997 book review, in the Texas Law Review, of Romantic Authorship 
and the Rhetoric of Property by James Boyle.) WIPO represents the interests of 
the holders of copyrights, patents and trademarks, and lobbies governments to 
increase their power. One WIPO treaty follows the lines of the Digital 
Millennium Copyright Act, which has been used to censor useful free software 
packages in the US. See http://www.wipout.net/ for a counter-WIPO campaign. 
``Open''
Please avoid using the word ``open'' as a substitute for ``free software''. A 
different group, whose values are less idealistic than ours, uses ``open 
source'' as its slogan. If you are referring to them, it is proper to use their 
name, but please don't lump us in with them or describe our work by their 
label---that leads people to think we are their supporters. 
``Piracy''
Publishers often refer to prohibited copying as ``piracy.'' In this way, they 
imply that illegal copying is ethically equivalent to attacking ships on the 
high seas, kidnaping and murdering the people on them. 
If you don't believe that illegal copying is just like kidnaping and murder, you 
might prefer not to use the word ``piracy'' to describe it. Neutral terms such 
as ``prohibited copying'' or ``unauthorized copying'' are available for use 
instead. Some of us might even prefer to use a positive term such as ``sharing 
information with your neighbor.'' 
``Protection''
Publishers' lawyers love to use the term ``protection'' to describe copyright. 
This word carries the implication of preventing destruction or suffering; 
therefore, it encourages people to identify with the owner and publisher who 
benefit from copyright, rather than with the users who are restricted by it. 
It is easy to avoid ``protection'' and use neutral terms instead. For example, 
instead of ``Copyright protection lasts a very long time,'' you can say, 
``Copyright lasts a very long time.'' 
If you want to criticize copyright instead of supporting it, you can use the 
term ``copyright restrictions.'' 
``RAND (reasonable and non-discriminatory)''
Standards bodies that promulgate patent-restricted standards that prohibit free 
software typically have a policy of obtaining patent licenses that require a 
fixed fee per copy of a conforming program. They often refer to such licenses by 
the term ``RAND,'' which stands for ``reasonable and non-discriminatory.'' 
That term white-washes a class of patent licenses that are normally neither 
reasonable nor non-discriminatory. It is true that these licenses do not 
discriminate against any specific person, but they do discriminate against the 
free software community, and that makes them unreasonable. Thus, half of 
``RAND'' is deceptive and the other half is prejudiced. 
Standards bodies should recognize that these licenses are discriminatory, and 
drop the use of the term ``reasonable and non-discriminatory'' or ``RAND'' to 
describe them. Until they do so, other writers who do not wish to join in the 
white-washing would do well to reject that term. To accept and use it merely 
because patent-wielding companies have made it widespread is to let those 
companies dictate the views you express. 
I suggest the term ``uniform fee only,'' or ``UFO'' for short, as a replacement. 
It is accurate because the only condition in these licenses is a uniform royalty 
fee. 
``Sell software''
The term ``sell software'' is ambiguous. Strictly speaking, exchanging a copy of 
a free program for a sum of money is ``selling''; but people usually associate 
the term ``sell'' with proprietary restrictions on the subsequent use of the 
software. You can be more precise, and prevent confusion, by saying either 
``distributing copies of a program for a fee'' or ``imposing proprietary 
restrictions on the use of a program,'' depending on what you mean. 
See Selling Free Software for more discussion of this issue. 
``Theft''
Copyright apologists often use words like ``stolen'' and ``theft'' to describe 
copyright infringement. At the same time, they ask us to treat the legal system 
as an authority on ethics: if copying is forbidden, it must be wrong. 
So it is pertinent to mention that the legal system--at least in the US--rejects 
the idea that copyright infringement is ``theft.'' Copyright apologists are 
making an appeal to authority...and misrepresenting what the authority says. 
The idea that laws decide what is right or wrong is mistaken in general. Laws 
are, at their best, an attempt to achieve justice; to say that laws define 
justice or ethical conduct is turning things upside down. 
``Vendor''
Please don't use the term ``vendor'' to refer generally to the developer of a 
software package. Many programs are developed in order to sell copies, and their 
developers truly are vendors; this even includes some free software packages. 
However, many programs are developed by individual volunteers, or by 
organizations, which do not intend to sell copies. Their developers are not 
vendors.
