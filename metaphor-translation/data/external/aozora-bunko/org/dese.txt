  Preface 
  In privacy and computer security, real information is too hard to find. Most 
  people don 't know what's really going on, and many people who do know aren't 
  telling. 
  This book was written to reveal a hidden truth. The standard way that the US 
  Government recommends that we make information secure and private, the "Data 
  Encryption Standard" or DES, does not actually make that information secure or 
  private. The government knows fairly simple ways to reveal the hidden 
  information (called "cracking" or "breaking" DES). 
  Many scientists and engineers have known or suspected this for years. The ones 
  who know exactly what the government is doing have been unable to tell the 
  public, fearing prosecution for revealing "classified" information. Those who 
  are only guessing have been reluctant to publish their guesses, for fear that 
  they have guessed wrong. 
  This book describes a machine which we actually built to crack DES. The 
  machine exists, and its existence can easily be verified. You can buy one 
  yourself, in the United States; or can build one yourself if you desire. The 
  machine was designed and built in the private sector, so it is not classified. 
  We have donated our design to the public domain, so it is not proprietary. 
  There is no longer any question that it can be built or has been built. We 
  have published its details so that other scientists and engineers can review, 
  reproduce, and build on our work. There can be no more doubt. DES is not 
  secure.

  Chapters 
  The first section of the book describes the Electronic Frontier Foundation's 
  research project to build a machine to crack DES. The next section provides 
  full technical details on the machine that we designed: for review, critique, 
  exploration, and further evolution by the cryptographic research community. 
  The final section includes several hard-to-find technical reports on brute 
  force methods of cracking DES. 
  Technical description 
  Chapter 1, Overview, introduces our project and gives the basic architecture 
  of the Electronic Frontier Foundation's DES-cracking machine. 
  Chapter 2, Design Specification, by Paul Kocher of Cryptography Research, 
  provides specifications for the machine from a software author's point of 
  view. 
  Chapter 3, Hardware Specification, by Advanced Wireless Technologies, provides 
  specifications for the custom gate array chips, and the boards that carry 
  them, from a hardware designer's point of view. 
  Technical design details 
  Chapter 4, Scanning the Source Code, explains how you can feed this book 
  through an optical scanner and regenerate the exact source code needed to 
  build the software and the specialized gate array chip that we designed. 
  Chapter 5, Software Source Code, contains a complete listing of the C-language 
  software that runs on a PC and controls the DES-Cracker. 
  Chapter 6, Chip Source Code, contains a complete listing of the chip design 
  language (VHDL) code that specifies how we designed the custom gate array 
  chip. 
  Chapter 7, Chip Simulator Source Code, contains a complete listing of the 
  C-language software that simulates the operation of the chip, for 
  understanding how the chip works, and for generating test-vectors to make sure 
  that the chips are properly fabricated. 
  Chapter 8, Hardware Board Schematics, provides schematic diagrams of the 
  boards which provide power and a computer interface to the custom chips, as 
  well as information on the layout of the boards and the backplanes that 
  connect them.

    Conclusion 

  Politics of Decryption 
  We began the Electronic Frontier Foundation's DES Cracker project because of 
  our interest in the politics of decryption.* The vulnerability of widely used 
  encryption standards like DES is important for the public to understand. 
  A "DES Cracker" is a machine that can read information encrypted with the Data 
  Encryption Standard (DES), by finding the key that was used to encrypt it. 
  "Cracking DES" is a name for this search process. It is most simply done by 
  trying every possible key until the right one is found, a tedious process 
  called "brute-force search". 
  If DES-encrypted information can easily be decrypted by those who are not 
  intended to see it, the privacy and security of our infrastructures that use 
  DES are at risk. Many political, social, and technological decisions depend on 
  just how hard it is to crack DES. 
  We noticed an increasing number of situations in which highly talented and 
  respected people from the U.S. Government were making statements about how 
  long it takes to crack DES. In all cases, these statements were at odds with 
  our own estimates and those of the cryptographic research community. A less 
  polite way to say it is that these government officials were lying, 
  incompetent, or both. They were stating that cracking DES is much more 
  expensive and time-consuming than we believed it to be. A very credible 
  research paper had predicted that a 
  _______________ 
  * DES, the Data Encryption Standard, encrypts a confidential message into 
  scrambled output under the control of a secret key. The input message is also 
  known as "plaintext", and the resulting output as "ciphertext". The idea is 
  that only recipients who know the secret key can decrypt the ciphertext to 
  obtain the original message. DES uses a 56-bit key, so there are 256 possible 
  keys.

  machine could be built for $1.5 million, including development costs, that 
  would crack DES in 3-1/2 hours. Yet we were hearing estimates of thousands of 
  computers and weeks to years to crack a single message. 
  On Thursday, June 26, 1997 the U.S. House of Representatives' Committee on 
  International Relations heard closed, classified testimony on encryption 
  policy issues. The Committee was considering a bill to eliminate export 
  controls on cryptography. After hearing this testimony, the Committee gutted 
  the bill and inserted a substitute intended to have the opposite effect. A 
  month later, a censored transcript of the hearing was provided; see 
  http://jya.com/hir-hear.htm. Here are excerpts: 
  Statement of Louis J. Freeh, Director, Federal Bureau of Investigation 
    . . . And we do not have the computers, we do not have the technology to get 
    either real-time access to that information or any kind of timely access. 
    If we hooked together thousands of computers and worked together over 4 
    months we might, as was recently demonstrated decrypt one message bit. That 
    is not going to make a difference in a kidnapping case, it is not going to 
    make a difference in a national security case. We don't have the technology 
    or the brute force capability to get to this information. 
  Statement of William P. Crowell, Deputy Director, National Security Agency 
    . . . I would go further and say there have been people who have said that 
    Louis Freeh's organization should just get smarter technically, and if they 
    were just smarter technically, they would be able to break all of this 
    stuff. I would like to leave you with just one set of statistics, and then I 
    think I am going to close with just a few comments on the bill itself. 
    There is no brute force solution for law enforcement. [blacked out 
    ----------------------------------------------] A group of students -- not 
    students -- the Internet gang last week broke a single message using 56-bit 
    DES. It took 78,000 computers 96 days to break one message, and the headline 
    was, DES has weak encryption. 
    He doesn't consider that very weak. If that had been 64-bit encryption, 
    which is available for export today, and is available freely for domestic 
    use, that same effort would have taken 7,000 years. And if it had been 
    128-bit cryptography, which is what PGP is, pretty good privacy, it would 
    have taken 8.6 trillion times the age of the universe.

  Comments made later in the hearing 
    Chairman Gilman. Would you need added manpower resource and equipment if 
    there is a need to decrypt? And would that add to your already difficult 
    case of language translation in many of your wiretaps? 
    Director Freeh. We would certainly need those resources, but I think more 
    importantly is the point that was made here. Contrary to the National 
    Research Council recommendation that the FBI buy more computers and Bill 
    Gates' suggestion to me that we upgrade our research and development 
    [blacked out------------------------------] American industry cannot do it, 
    and that is decrypt real time encryption over a very minimal level of 
    robustness. [blacked out---------] If you gave me $3 million to buy a Cray 
    computer, it would take me how many years to do one message bit? 
    Mr. Crowell. 64 bits, 7,000 years. 
    Director Freeh. I don't have that time in a kidnapping case. It would kill 
    us. 
  On March 17, 1998, Robert S. Litt, Principal Associate Deputy Attorney 
  General, testified to the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, Subcommittee on the 
  Constitution, Federalism, and Property. The subject of the hearing was 
  "Privacy in a Digital Age: Encryption and Mandatory Access". Mr. Litt's whole 
  statement is available at 
  http://www.computerprivacy.org/archive/03171998-4.shtml. The part relevant to 
  DES cracking is: 
    Some people have suggested that this is a mere resource problem for law 
    enforcement. They believe that law enforcement agencies should simply focus 
    their resources on cracking strong encryption codes, using high-speed 
    computers to try every possible key when we need lawful access to the 
    plaintext of data or communications that is evidence of a crime. But that 
    idea is simply unworkable, because this kind of brute force decryption takes 
    too long to be useful to protect the public safety. For example, decrypting 
    one single message that had been encrypted with a 56-bit key took 14,000 
    Pentium-level computers over four months; obviously, these kinds of 
    resources are not available to the FBI, let alone the Jefferson City Police 
    Department. 
  What's Wrong With Their Statements? 
  Some of the testimony quoted may have been literally true; nevertheless, it is 
  deceptive. All of the time estimates presented by Administration officials 
  were based on use of general-purpose computers to do the job. But that's 
  fundamentally the wrong way to do it, and they know it. 
  A ordinary computer is ill-suited for use as a DES Cracker. In the first 
  place, the design of DES is such that it is inherently very slow in software, 
  but fast in hardware. Second, current computers do very little in parallel; 
  the designers don't know exactly what instructions will be executed, and must 
  allow for all combinations. 



  1-4 
  The right way to crack DES is with special-purpose hardware. A custom-designed 
  chip, even with a slow clock, can easily outperform even the fastest 
  general-purpose computer. Besides, you can get many such chips on a single 
  board, rather than the one or two on a typical computer's motherboard. 
  There are practical limits to the key sizes which can be cracked by 
  brute-force searching, but since NSA deliberately limited the key size of DES 
  to 56 bits, back in the 1970's when it was designed, DES is crackable by brute 
  force. Today's technology might not be able to crack other ciphers with 64-bit 
  or 128-bit keys--or it might. Nobody will know until they have tried, and 
  published the details for scientific scrutiny. Most such ciphers have very 
  different internal structure than DES, and it may be possible to eliminate 
  large numbers of possible keys by taking advantage of the structure of the 
  cipher. Some senior cryptographers estimated what key sizes were needed for 
  safety in a 1996 paper;* they suggest that to protect against brute force 
  cracking, today's keys should have a minimum of 75 bits, and to protect 
  information for twenty years, a minimum of 90 bits. 
  The cost of brute-force searching also overstates the cost of recovering 
  encrypted text in the real world. A key report on the real impact of 
  encryption on law enforcement+ reveals that there are no cases in which a lack 
  of police access to encrypted files resulted in a suspected criminal going 
  free. In most cases the plaintext was recovered by other means, such as asking 
  the suspect for the key, or finding another copy of the information on the 
  disk. Even when brute force is the method of choice, keys are seldom truly 
  random, and can be searched in the most likely order. 
  Export Controls and DES 
  The U.S. Government currently restricts the ability of companies, individuals, 
  and researchers to export hardware or software that includes the use of DES 
  for confidentiality. These "export controls" have been a severe impediment to 
  the development of security and privacy for networked computers, cellular 
  phones, and other popular communications devices. The use of encryption 
  algorithms stronger than DES is also restricted. 
  In December 1996, the government formally offered exporters the ability to 
  incorporate DES, but nothing stronger, into their products. The catch is that 
  these companies would have to sign an agreement with the government, 
  obligating them to

  install "key recovery" into their products within two years. Key recovery 
  technology provides a way for the government to decrypt messages at will, by 
  offering the government a copy of the key used in each message, in a way that 
  the product's user cannot circumvent or control. In short, the government's 
  offer was: collude with us to violate your customers' privacy, or we won't let 
  you export any kind of secure products. 
  At the same time, the FBI was let into the group that reviews each individual 
  company's application to export a cryptographic product. All reports indicate 
  that the FBI is making good on the threat, by objecting to the export of all 
  kinds of products that pose no threat at all to the national security (having 
  been exportable in previous years before the FBI gained a voice). The FBI 
  appears to think that by making itself hated and feared, it will encourage 
  companies to follow orders. Instead it is encouraging companies to overturn 
  the regulatory scheme that lets the FBI abuse the power to control exports. 
  Industry started a major lobbying group called Americans for Computer Privacy 
  (http://www.computerprivacy.org), which is attempting to change the laws to 
  completely decontrol nonmilitary encryption exports. 
  Some dozens of companies to signed up for key recovery, though it is unclear 
  how many actually plan to follow through on their promise to deploy the 
  technology. You will not find many of these companies trumpeting key recovery 
  in their product advertisements. Users are wary of it since they know it means 
  compromised security. If customers won't buy such products, companies know it 
  makes no sense to develop them. 
  The best course for companies is probably to develop products that provide 
  actual security, in some jurisdiction in the world which does not restrict 
  their export. Some companies are doing so. The government's "compromise" offer 
  discourages hesitant companies from taking this step, by providing a more 
  moderate and conciliatory step that they can take instead. Companies that go 
  to the effort to build overseas cryptographic expertise all use stronger 
  technology than DES, as a selling point and to guard against early 
  obsolescence. If those companies can be convinced to stay in the US, play the 
  government's key-recovery game, and stick with DES, the government continues 
  to win, and the privacy of the public continues to lose. 
  The success or failure of the government's carrot-and-stick approach depends 
  on keeping industry and the public misled about DES's security. If DES-based 
  products were perceived as insecure, there would be little reason for 
  companies to sign away their customers' privacy birthrights in return for a 
  mess of DES pottage. If DES-based products are perceived as secure, but the 
  government actually knows that the products are insecure, then the government 
  gets concessions from companies,

  without impacting its ability to intercept communications. Keeping the public 
  ignorant gives the government the best of both worlds. 
  Political Motivations and EFF's Response 
  We speculate that government officials are deliberately misleading the public 
  about the strength of DES encryption: 
    To encourage the public to continue using DES, so their agencies can 
    eavesdrop on the public. 
    To prevent the widespread adoption of stronger standards than DES, which the 
    government would have more trouble decrypting. 
    To offer DES exportability as a bargaining-chip, which actually costs the 
    government little, but is perceived to be valuable. 
    To encourage policy-makers such as Congressmen or the President to impose 
    drastic measures such as key recovery, in the belief that law enforcement 
    has a major encrypted-data problem and no practical way to crack codes. 
  As advocates on cryptography policy, we found ourselves in a hard situation. 
  It appeared that highly credible people were either deliberately lying to 
  Congress and to the public in order to advance their own harmful agendas, or 
  were advocating serious infringement of civil liberties based on their own 
  ignorance of the underlying issues. Most troubling is the possibility that 
  they were lying. Perhaps these government executives merely saw themselves as 
  shielding valuable classified efforts from disclosure. As advocates of good 
  government, we do not see that classifying a program is any justification for 
  an official to perjure themselves when testifying about it. (Declining to 
  state an opinion is one thing; making untruthful statements as if they were 
  facts is quite another.) 
  The National Research Council studied encryption issues and published a very 
  complete 1996 report.* The most interesting conclusion of their report was 
  that "the debate over national cryptography policy can be carried out in a 
  reasonable manner on an unclassified basis". This presumes good faith on the 
  part of the agencies who hide behind classified curtains, though. If it turns 
  out that their public statements are manipulative falsehoods, an honest and 
  reasonable public debate must necessarily exclude them, as dishonest and 
  unreasonable participants. 
  In the alternative, if poor policy decisions are being made based on the 
  ignorance or incompetence of senior government officials, the role of honest 
  advocates should be to inform the debate.

  In response to these concerns, EFF began a research program. Our research 
  results prove that DES can be cracked quickly on a low budget. This proves 
  that these officials were either lying or incompetent. The book you are 
  holding documents the research, and allows it to be validated by other 
  scientists. 
  Goals 
  The goal of EFF's DES Cracker research project is to determine just how cheap 
  or expensive it is to build a machine that cracks DES usefully. 
  Technically, we were also interested in exploring good designs for plaintext 
  recognizers. These are circuits that can notice when the result of decryption 
  is likely enough to be correct that specialized software--or a human--should 
  look at it. Little research has been published on them,* yet they are a vital 
  part of any efficient system for cryptanalysis. 
  Merely doing the research would let EFF learn the truth about the expense of 
  cracking DES. But only publishing the research and demonstrating the machine 
  would educate the public on the truth about the strength of DES. Press 
  releases and even technical papers would not suffice; the appearance of 
  schematics for a million-dollar DES Cracker in Michael Wiener's excellent 1993 
  paper should have been enough. But people still deploy DES, and Congressmen 
  blindly accept the assurances of high officials about its strength. 
  There are many people who will not believe a truth until they can see it with 
  their own eyes. Showing them a physical machine that can crack DES in a few 
  days is the only way to convince some people that they really cannot trust 
  their security to DES. 
  Another set of people might not believe our claims unless several other teams 
  have reproduced them. (This is a basic part of the scientific method.) And 
  many people will naturally be interested in how such a box works, and how it 
  was built for only about $200,000. This book was written for such people. It 
  contains the complete specifications and design documents for the DES Cracker, 
  as well as circuit diagrams for its boards, and complete listings of its 
  software and its gate array design. The full publication of our design should 
  enable other teams to rapidly reproduce, validate, and improve on our design.

  History of DES Cracking 
  DES Crackers have been mentioned in the scientific and popular literature 
  since the 1970s. Whitfield Diffie's Foreword describes several of them. The 
  most recent detailed description was in a paper by Michael Wiener of Bell 
  Northern Research in 1993. Wiener's paper included a detailed hardware design 
  of a DES Cracker built with custom chips. The chips were to be built into 
  boards, and the boards into mechanical "frames" like those of telephone 
  central office switches. A completed design would have cost about a million 
  dollars and would determine a DES key from known plaintext and known 
  ciphertext in an average of 3-1/2 hours (7 hours in the worst case). 
  Mr. Wiener updated his conclusions in 1998, adjusting for five years of 
  technological change. His update paper is included in this book, thanks to the 
  courtesy of RSA Data Security, which originally published his update. 
  Ian Goldberg and David Wagner of the University of California at Berkeley took 
  a different approach. Their design used a "field programmable gate array" 
  (FPGA), which is a chip that can be reprogrammed after manufacturing into a 
  variety of different circuits. 
  FPGA chips are slower than the custom chips used in the Wiener design, but can 
  be bought quickly in small quantities, without a large initial investment in 
  design. Rather than spend a big chunk of a million dollars to design a big 
  machine, these researchers bought one or two general purpose chips and 
  programmed them to be a slow DES Cracker. This let them quickly measure how 
  many slow chips they would need to pile up to make a practical DES Cracker. 
  Their paper is also included in this book. 
  EFF's DES Cracker Project 
  The Electronic Frontier Foundation began its investigation into DES Cracking 
  in 1997. The original plan was to see if a DES Cracker could be built out of a 
  machine containing a large number of FPGA's. 
  Large machines built out of FPGAs exist in the commercial market for use in 
  simulating large new chip designs before the chip is built. A collection of 
  thousands of relatively incapable FPGA chips can be put together to simulate 
  one very capable custom chip, although at 1/10th or 1/100th of the speed that 
  the eventual custom chip would run at. This capability is used by chip 
  designers to work the "bugs" out of their chip before committing to the 
  expensive and time-consuming step of fabricating physical chips from their 
  design. 
  EFF never got access to such a chip simulator. Instead, our investigations led 
  us to Paul Kocher of Cryptography Research. Paul had previously worked with a 
  team 



  1-9 
  of hardware designers who knew how to build custom gate array chips cheaply, 
  in batches of a few thousand chips at a time. 
  Paul and EFF met with the chip designers at Advanced Wireless Technologies, 
  and determined that a workable DES Cracker could be built on a budget of about 
  $200,000. The resulting machine would take less than a week, on average, to 
  determine the key from a single 8-byte sample of known plaintext and 
  ciphertext. Moreover, it would determine the key from a 16-byte sample of 
  ciphertext in almost the same amount of time, if the statistical 
  characteristics of the plaintext were known or guessable. For example, if the 
  plaintext was known to be an electronic mail message, it could find all keys 
  that produce plaintext containing nothing but letters, numbers, and 
  punctuation. This makes the machine much more usable for solving real-world 
  decryption problems. 
  There is nothing revolutionary in our DES Cracker. It uses ordinary ideas 
  about how to crack DES that have been floating around in the cryptographic 
  research community for many years. The only difference is that we actually 
  built it, instead of just writing papers about it. Very similar machines could 
  have been built last year, or the year before, or five or ten years ago; they 
  would have just been slower or more expensive. 
  Architecture 
  The design of the EFF DES Cracker is simple in concept. It consists of an 
  ordinary personal computer connected with a large array of custom chips. 
  Software in the personal computer instructs the custom chips to begin 
  searching, and interacts with the user. The chips run without further help 
  from the software until they find a potentially interesting key, or need to be 
  directed to search a new part of the key space. The software periodically 
  polls the chips to find any potentially interesting keys that they have turned 
  up. 
  The hardware's job isn't to find the answer. but rather to eliminate most of 
  the answers that are incorrect. Software is then fast enough to search the 
  remaining potentially-correct keys, winnowing the false positives" from the 
  real answer. The strength of the machine is that it replicates a simple but 
  useful search circuit thousands of times, allowing the software to find the 
  answer by searching only a tiny fraction of the key space. 
  As long as there is a small bit of software to coordinate the effort, the 
  problem of searching for a DES key is "highly parallelizable". This means the 
  problem can be usefully solved by many machines working in parallel, 
  simultaneously. For example, a single DES-Cracker chip could find a key by 
  searching for many years. A thousand DES-Cracker chips can solve the same 
  problem in one thousandth of the time. A million DES-Cracker chips could 
  theoretically solve the same problem in 



  1-10 
  about a millionth of the time, though the overhead of starting each chip would 
  become visible in the time required. The actual machine we built contains 1536 
  chips. 
  When conducting a brute-force search, the obvious thing to do is to try every 
  possible key, but there are some subtleties. You can try the keys in any 
  order. If you think the key isn't randomly selected, start with likely ones. 
  When you finally find the right key, you can stop; you don't have to try all 
  the rest of the keys. You might find it in the first million tries; you might 
  find it in the last million tries. On average, you find it halfway through 
  (after trying half the keys). As a result, the timings for brute-force 
  searches are generally given as the average time to find a key. The maximum 
  time is double the average time. 
  Search units 
  The search unit is the heart of the EFF DES Cracker; it contains thousands of 
  them. 
  A search unit is a small piece of hardware that takes a key and two 64-bit 
  blocks of ciphertext. It decrypts a block of ciphertext with the key, and 
  checks to see if the resulting block of plaintext is "interesting". If not, it 
  adds 1 to the key and repeats, searching its way through the key space. 
  If the first decryption produces an "interesting" result, the same key is used 
  to decrypt the second block of ciphertext. If both are interesting, the search 
  unit stops and tells the software that it has found an interesting key. If the 
  second block's decryption is uninteresting, the search unit adds one to the 
  key and goes on searching the key space. 
  When a search unit stops after finding an interesting result, software on the 
  host computer must examine the result, and determine whether it's the real 
  answer, or just a "false positive". A false positive is a plaintext that 
  looked interesting to the hardware, but which actually isn't a solution to the 
  problem. The hardware is designed to produce some proportion of false 
  positives along with the real solution. (The job of the hardware isn't to find 
  the answer, but to eliminate the vast majority of the non-answers.) As long as 
  the false positives don't occur so rapidly that they overwhelm the software's 
  ability to check and reject them, they don't hurt, and they simplify the 
  hardware and allow it to be more general-purpose. For the kinds of problems 
  that we're trying to solve, the hardware is designed to waste less than 1% of 
  the search time on false positives. 



  1-11 
  Recognizing interesting plaintext 
  What defines an interesting result? If we already know the plaintext, and are 
  just looking for the key, an interesting result would be if the plaintext from 
  this key matches our known block of plaintext. If we don't know the plaintext, 
  perhaps the guess that it's all composed of letters, digits, and punctuation 
  defines "interesting". The test has to be simple yet flexible. We ended up 
  with one that's simple for the hardware, but a bit more complicated for the 
  software. 
  Each result contains eight 8-bit bytes. First, the search unit looks at each 
  byte of the result. Such a byte can have any one of 256 values. The search 
  unit is set up with a table that defines which of these 256 byte values are 
  "interesting" and which are uninteresting. For example, if the plaintext is 
  known to be all numeric, the software sets up the table so that the ten digits 
  (0 to 9) are interesting, and all other potential values are uninteresting. 
  The result of decrypting with the wrong key will look pretty close to random. 
  So the chance of having a single byte look "interesting" will be based on what 
  fraction of the 256 values are defined to be "interesting". If, say, 69 
  characters are interesting (A-Z, a-z, 0-9, space, and a few punctuation 
  characters), then the chance of a random byte appearing to be interesting is 
  69/256 or about 1/4. These don't look like very good odds; the chip would be 
  stopping on one out of every four keys, to tell the software about 
  "interesting" but wrong keys. 
  But the "interest" test is repeated on each byte in the result. If the chance 
  of having a wrong key's byte appear interesting is 1/4, then the chance of two 
  bytes appearing interesting is 1/4 of 1/4, or 1/16th. For three bytes, 1/4th 
  of 1/4th of 1/4th, or 1/64th. By the time the chip examines all 8 bytes of a 
  result, it only makes a mistake on 1/65536th of the keys (l/48 keys). 
  That seems like a pretty small number, but when you're searching through 
  72,057,594,037,927,936 keys (256 keys, or 72 quadrillion keys), you need all 
  the help you can get. Even having the software examine 1/65536th of the 
  possible keys would require looking at 1,099,511,627,776 keys (240 or about a 
  trillion keys). So the chip provides a bit more help. 
  This help comes from that second block of ciphertext. If every byte of a 
  result looks interesting when the first block of ciphertext is decrypted, the 
  chip goes back around and decrypts the second block of ciphertext with the 
  same key. This divides the "error rate" by another factor of 65536, leaving 
  the software with only 16,777,216 (224 or about sixteen million) keys to look 
  at. Software on modern computers is capable of handling this in a reasonable 
  amount of time. 
  (If we only know one block of ciphertext, we just give the chip two copies of 
  the same ciphertext. It will test both copies, and eventually tell us that the 
  block is 



  1-12 
  interesting. The amount of time it spends checking this "second block" is 
  always a tiny fraction of the total search time.) 
  In the plaintext recognizer there are also 8 bits that lets us specify which 
  bytes of a plaintext are interesting to examine. For example, if we know or 
  suspect the contents of the first six bytes of a plaintext value, but don't 
  know anything about the last two bytes, we can search for keys which match in 
  just those six bytes. 
  Known plaintext 
  The chips will have many fewer "false positives" if the plaintext of the 
  message is known, instead of just knowing its general characteristics. In that 
  case, only a small number of byte values will be "interesting". If the 
  plaintext has no repeated byte values, only eight byte values will be 
  interesting, instead of 69 as above. 
  For example, if the plaintext block is "hello th", then only the six byte 
  values "h", "e", "l", "o", space, and "t" are interesting. If a plaintext 
  contains only these bytes, it is interesting. We'll get some "false positives" 
  since many plaintexts like "tholo tt" would appear "interesting" even though 
  they don't match exactly. 
  Using this definition of "interesting", a byte resulting from a wrong key will 
  look interesting only about 8/256ths of the time, or 1/32nd of the time. All 
  eight bytes resulting from a wrong key will look interesting only 1/32nd to 
  the eighth power (1/32nd of 1/32nd of 1/32nd of 1/32nd of 1/32nd of 1/32nd of 
  1/32nd of 1/32nd) of the time, or 1/1,099,511,627,776th of the time (1/240 of 
  the time). In other words, a search unit can try an average of a trillion keys 
  before reporting that a wrong key looks interesting. This lets it search for a 
  long time without slowing down or bothering the software. 
  Speed 
  Once you get it going, a search unit can do one decryption in 16 clock cycles. 
  The chips we have built can run with a clock of 40 Mhz (40 million cycles per 
  second). Dividing 16 into 40 million shows that each search unit can try about 
  2.5 million keys per second. 
  In building the search units, we discovered that we could make them run faster 
  if we used simpler circuitry for adding 1 to a key. Rather than being able to 
  count from a key of O all the way up to a key of all ones, we limited the 
  adder so that it can only count the bottom 32 bits of the key. The top 24 bits 
  always remain the same. At a rate of 2.5 million keys per second, it takes a 
  search unit 1717 seconds (about half an hour) to search all the possible keys 
  that have the same top 24 bits. At the end of half an hour, the software has 
  to stop the chip, reload it with a new value in the top 24 bits, and start it 
  going again. 



  1-13 
  Feedback Modes 
  The chip can also decrypt ciphertext that was encrypted in "Cipher Block 
  Chaining" mode. In this mode, the ciphertext of each block is exclusive-OR'd 
  into the plaintext of the next block before it is encrypted. (An 
  "initialization vector" is exclusive-OR'd into the first block of plaintext.) 
  The search unit knows how to exclusive-OR out an Initialization Vector (IV) 
  after decrypting the first ciphertext, and to exclusive-OR out the first 
  ciphertext after decrypting the second one. The software specifies the IV at 
  the same time it provides the ciphertext values. 
  Blaze Challenge 
  In June, 1997 Matt Blaze, a cryptography researcher at AT&T, proposed a 
  different sort of cryptographic challenge. He wanted a challenge that not even 
  the proponent knew how to solve, without either doing a massive search of the 
  key-space, or somehow cryptanalyzing the structure of DES. 
  His challenge is merely to find a key such that a ciphertext block of the form 
  XXXXXXXX decrypts to a plaintext block of the form YYYYYYYY, where X and Y are 
  any fixed 8-bit value that is repeated across each of the eight bytes of the 
  block. 
  We added a small amount of hardware to the search units to help with solving 
  this challenge. There is an option to exclusive-OR the right half of the 
  plaintext into the left half, before looking to see if the plaintext is 
  "interesting". For plaintexts of the form YYYYYYYY, this will result in a left 
  half of all zeros. We can then set up the plaintext recognizer so it only 
  looks at the left half, and only thinks zeroes are interesting. This will 
  produce a large number of false positives (any plaintext where the left and 
  right halves are equal, like ABCDABCD), but software can screen them out with 
  only about a 1% performance loss. 
  Structure Of The Machine 
  Now that you know how a single search unit works, let's put them together into 
  the whole machine. 
  Each search unit fits inside a custom chip. In fact, 24 search units fit 
  inside a single chip. All the search units inside a chip share the same 
  ciphertext blocks. initialization vector, and the same plaintext-recognizer 
  table of "interesting" result values. Each search unit has its own key, and 
  each can be stopped and started independently. 
  The chip provides a simple interface on its wires. There are a few signals 
  that say whether any of the search units are stopped, some address and data 
  wires so that 



  1-14 
  the software can read and write to the search units, and wires for electrical 
  power and grounding. 
  Since each search unit tries 2.5 million keys per second, a chip with 24 
  search units will try 60 million keys per second. But there are a lot of keys 
  to look at. For a single chip, it would take 6,950 days (about 19 years) to 
  find the average key, or 38 years to search the entire key space. Since we 
  don't want to wait that long, we use more than one chip. 
  Each chip is mounted onto a large circuit board that contains 64 chips, along 
  with a small bit of interface circuitry. The board blinks a light whenever the 
  software is talking to that board. 64 other lights show when some search unit 
  in each chip has stopped. In normal operation the software will talk to the 
  board every few seconds, to check up on the chips. The chips should only stop 
  every once in a while, and should be quickly restarted by the software. 
  The boards are designed to the mechanical specifications of "9U" VMEbus boards 
  (about 15" by 15"). VMEbus is an industrial standard for computer boards, 
  which was popular in the 1980s. We used the VMEbus form factor because it was 
  easy to buy equipment that such boards plug into; we don't actually use the 
  VMEbus electrical specifications. 
  9U VMEbus boards are much larger than the average interface card that plugs 
  into a generic PC, so a lot more chips can be put onto them. Also, 9U VMEbus 
  boards are designed to supply a lot of power, and our DES Cracker chips need 
  it. 
  Since each chip searches 60 million keys per second, a board containing 64 
  chips will search 3.8 billion keys per second. Searching half the key space 
  would take the board about 109 days. Since we don't want to wait that long 
  either, we use more than one board. 
  The boards are mounted into chassis, also called "card cages". In the current 
  design, these chassis are recycled Sun workstation packages from about 1990. 
  Sun Microsystems built a large number of systems that used the large 9U VMEbus 
  boards, and provide excellent power and cooling for the boards. The Sun-4/470 
  chassis provides twelve slots for VMEbus boards, and can easily be modified to 
  handle our requirements. Subsequent models may use other physical packaging. 
  Each chassis has a connector for a pair of "ribbon cables" to connect it to 
  the next chassis and to the generic PC that runs the software. The last 
  chassis will contain a "terminator", rather than a connection to the next 
  chassis, to keep the signals on the ribbon cable from getting distorted when 
  they reach the end of the line. 
  Since each board searches 3.8 billion keys per second, a chassis containing 12 
  boards will search 46 billion keys per second. At that rate, searching half 
  the key space takes about 9 days. One chassis full of boards is about 25% 
  faster than the 



  1-15 
  entire worldwide network of machines that solved the RSA "DES-II" challenge in 
  February 1998, which was testing about 34 billion keys per second at its peak. 

  Since an informal design goal for our initial DES Cracker was to crack an 
  average DES key in less than a week, we need more than 12 boards. To give 
  ourselves a comfortable margin, we are using 24 boards, which we can fit into 
  two chassis. They will search 92 billion keys per second, covering half the 
  key space in about 4.5 days. If the chips consume too much power or produce 
  too much heat for two chassis to handle,* we can spread the 24 boards across 
  three chassis.

  We designed the search unit once. Then we got a speedup factor of more than 
  36,000 to 1 just by replicating it 24 times in each chip and making 1500 
  chips. This is what we meant by "highly parallelizable" 
  Budget 
  The whole project was budgeted at about US$210,000. Of this, $80,000 is for 
  the labor of designing, integrating, and testing the DES Cracker. The other 
  $130,000 is for materials, including chips, boards, all other components on 
  the boards, card cages, power supplies, cooling, and a PC. 
  The software for controlling the DES Cracker was written separately, as a 
  volunteer project. It took two or three weeks of work. 
  The entire project was completed within about eighteen months. Much of that 
  time was used for preliminary research, before deciding to use a custom chip 
  rather than FPGA's. The contract to build custom chips was signed in 
  September, 1997, about eight months into the project. The team contained less 
  than ten people, none of whom worked full-time on the project. They include a 
  project manager, software designer, programmer, chip designer, board designer, 
  hardware technicians, and hardware managers. 
  _________________ 
  * At publication time, we have tested individual chips but have yet not built 
  the full machine If the chips' power consumption or heat production is 
  excessive in a machine containing 1500 chips, we also have the option to 
  reduce the chips' clock rate from 40 MHz down to, say, 30 MHz. This would 
  significantly reduce the power and heat problems, at a cost of 33% more time 
  per search (6 days on average). 



  1-16 
  We could have reduced the per-chip cost, or increased the chip density or 
  search speed, had we been willing to spend more money on design. A more 
  complex design could also have been flexible enough to crack other encryption 
  algorithms. The real point is that for a budget that any government, most 
  companies, and tens of thousands of individuals could afford, we built a 
  usable DES Cracking machine. The publication of our design will probably in 
  itself reduce the design cost of future machines, and the advance of 
  semiconductor technology also makes this cost likely to drop. In five years 
  some teenager may well build her own DES Cracker as a high school science fair 
  project. 
  Who Else Is Cracking DES? 
  If a civil liberties group can build a DES Cracker for $200,000, it's pretty 
  likely that governments can do the same thing for under a million dollars. 
  (That's a joke.) Given the budget and mission of the US National Security 
  Agency, they must have started building DES Crackers many years ago. We would 
  guess that they are now on their fourth or fifth generation of such devices. 
  They are probably using chips that are much faster than the ones we used; 
  modern processor chips can run at more than 300 Mhz, eight times as fast as 
  our 40 Mhz chips. They probably have small "field" units that fit into a 
  suitcase and crack DES in well under a day; as well as massive central units 
  buried under Ft. Meade, that find the average DES key in seconds, or find 
  thousands of DES keys in parallel, examining thousands of independent 
  intercepted messages. 
  Our design would scale up to finding a DES key in about half an hour, if you 
  used 333,000 chips on more than 5,200 boards. The boards would probably 
  require about 200 parallel port cards to communicate with them; an 
  IBM-compatible PC could probably drive four such cards, thus requiring about 
  50 PC's too. The software required would be pretty simple: the hard part would 
  be the logistics of physical arrangement and repair. This is about 200 times 
  as much hardware as the project we built. A ridiculously high upper bound on 
  the price of such a system would be 200 times the current project price, or 
  $40 million. 
  Of course, if we were going to build a system to crack DES in half an hour or 
  less, using a third of a million chips, it would be better to go back to the 
  drawing board and design from scratch. We'd use more modern chip fabrication 
  processes; a higher-volume customer can demand this. We'd spend more on the 
  initial design and the software, to produce a much cheaper and simpler total 
  system, perhaps allowing boards full of denser, faster, lower-voltage chips to 
  use a small onboard processor and plug directly into an Ethernet. We'd work 
  hard to reduce the cost of each chip, since there would be so many of them. 
  We'd think about how to crack multiple DES keys simultaneously. 



  1-17 
  It would be safe to assume that any large country has DES Cracking machines. 
  After the publication of this book wakes them up, probably more small 
  countries and some criminal organizations will make or buy a few DES Crackers. 
  That was not the intent of the book; the intent was to inform and warn the 
  targets of this surveillance, the builders of equipment, and the policy makers 
  who grapple with encryption issues. 
  What To Do If You Depend On DES 
  Don't design anything else that depends on single DES. 
  Take systems out of service that use permanently fixed single-DES keys, or 
  superencrypt the traffic at a higher level. Superencryption requires special 
  care, though, to avoid providing any predictable headers that can be used to 
  crack the outer DES encryption. 
  Start changing your software and/or hardware to use a stronger algorithm than 
  DES. 
  Three-key Triple-DES is an obvious choice, since it uses the same block size 
  and can possibly use the same hardware; it just uses three keys and runs DES 
  three times (encrypting each block with the first key, decrypting it with the 
  second, then encrypting it with the third). The strength of Triple-DES is not 
  known with any certainty, but it is certainly no weaker than single DES, and 
  is probably substantially stronger. Beware of "mixed up" variants or modes of 
  Triple-DES; research by Eli Biham* and David Wagner+ shows that they are 
  significantly weaker than the straightforward Triple-DES, and may be even 
  weaker than single-DES. Use three copies of DES in Electronic Code Book (ECB) 
  mode as a basic primitive. You can then build a mode such as Cipher Feedback 
  mode using the primitive ECB 3DES. 
  The US Government is tardily going through a formal process to replace the 
  DES. This effort, called the Advanced Encryption Standard, will take several 
  years to decide on a final algorithm, and more years for it to be proven out 
  in actual use, and carefully scrutinized by public cryptanalysts for hidden 
  weaknesses. If you are designing products to appear five to ten years from 
  now, the AES might be a good source of an encryption algorithm for you. 
  The reason that the AES is tardy is because the NSA is believed to have 
  blocked previous attempts to begin the process over the last decade. In recent 
  years NSA

  has tried, without success, to get the technical community to use classified, 
  NSA-designed encryption algorithms such as Skipjack, without letting the users 
  subject these algorithms to public scrutiny. Only after this effort failed did 
  they permit the National Institute of Standards and Technology to begin the 
  AES standardization process. 
  Conclusion 
  The Data Encryption Standard has served the public pretty well since 1975. But 
  it was designed in an era when computation cost real money, when massive 
  computers hunkered on special raised flooring in air-conditioned inner 
  sanctums. In an era when you can carry a supercomputer in your backpack, and 
  access millions of machines across the Internet, the Data Encryption Standard 
  is obsolete. 
  The Electronic Frontier Foundation hopes that this book inspires a new level 
  of truth to enter the policy debates on encryption. In order to make wise 
  choices for our society, we must make well-informed choices. Great deference 
  has been paid to the perspective and experience of the National Security 
  Agency and Federal Bureau of Investigation in these debates. This is 
  particularly remarkable given the lack of any way for policy-makers or the 
  public to check the accuracy of many of their statements.* (The public cannot 
  even hear many of their statements, because they are classified as state 
  secrets.) We hope that the crypto policy debate can move forward to a more 
  successful and generally supported policy. Perhaps if these agencies will 
  consider becoming more truthful, or policy-makers will stop believing 
  unverified statements from them, the process can move more rapidly to such a 
  conclusion.

  * DES cracking is not the only issue on which agency credibility is 
  questionable. For example, the true extent of the law enforcement problem 
  posed by cryptography is another issue on which official dire predictions have 
  been made, while more careful and unbiased studies have shown little or no 
  impact. The validity of the agencies' opinion of the constitutionality of 
  their own regulations is also in doubt, having been rejected two decades ago 
  by the Justice Department, and declared unconstitutional in 1997 by a Federal 
  District Court. The prevalence of illegal wiretapping and communications 
  interception by government employees is also in question; see for example the

  On-Chip Registers 
  Each chip contains the following registers. They are addressed as specified in 
  Figure 2-1. 
  Ciphertext0 (64 bits = 8 bytes) 
  The value of the first ciphertext being searched. Ciphertext0 is identical in 
  all search units and is set only once (when the search system is first 
  initialized). 
  Ciphertext1 (64 bits = 8 bytes) 
  The value of the second ciphertext being searched. Ciphertext1 is identical in 
  all search units and is set only once (when the search system is first 
  initialized). 
  PlaintextByteMask (8 bits) 
  The plaintext byte selector. One-bits in this register indicate plaintext 
  bytes that should be ignored when deciding whether or not the plaintext 
  produced by a particular key is possibly correct. This mask is helpful when 
  only a portion of the plaintext's value is known. For example, if the first 5 
  bytes equal a known header but the remaining three are unknown, a 
  PlaintextByteMask of 0x07 would be used. 
  PlaintextXorMask (64 bits = 8 bytes) 
  This register is XORed with decryption of ciphertext0. This is normally filled 
  with

  the CBC mode IV. 
  PlaintextVector (256 bits = 8 bytes) 
  Identifies allowable plaintext byte values (ignoring those masked by the 
  PlaintextByteMask). If, for any plaintext byte P[i=0..7], bit P[i] is not set, 
  the decryption key will be rejected. PlaintextVector is identical in all 
  search units and is set only once (when the search system is first 
  initialized). 
  SearchInfo (8 bits) 
  The bits in SearchInfo describe how the correct plaintext identification 
  function works. Bits of SearchInfo are defined as follows: 



  2-3 
  bit 0 = UseCBC 
  If this bit is set, Ciphertext0 is XORed onto the plaintext produced by 
  decrypting Ciphertext1 before the plaintext is checked. This bit is used when 
  checking CBC-mode ciphertexts. 
  bit 1 = ExtraXOR 
  If set, the right half of the resulting plaintext is XORed onto the left 
  before any plaintext checking is done. ExtraXOR and UseCBC cannot be used 
  together. 
  bit 2 = ChipAllActive 
  If cleared, one or more search units in this chip have halted (e.g., 
  SearchActive is zero). This value is computed by ANDing the SearchActive bits 
  of all search units' SearchStatus bytes. The inverse of this value is sent out 
  on a dedicated pin, for use in driving a status LED which lights up whenever 
  the chip halts. 
  bit 3 = BoardAllActive 
  This pin is the AND of the ChipAllActive lines of this chip and all later 
  chips on the board. This is implemented by having each chip n take in chip 
  n+1's BoardAllActive line, AND it with its own ChipAllActive line, and output 
  the result to chip n-1 for its BoardAllActive computation. This makes it 
  possible to find which chip on a board has halted by querying log2N chips, 
  where N is the number of chips on the board. If BoardAllActiveEnable is not 
  set to 1, BoardAllActive simply equals the BoardAllActiveInput pin, regardless 
  of the chip's internal state. 
  bit 4 = BoardAllActiveEnable 
  If this value is set to 0 then BoardAllActive always equals the 
  BoardAllActiveInput pin, regardless of whether all search units on the board 
  are active. If this bit is set to 1, then the BoardAllActive register (and 
  output) are set to reflect the internal state of the chip ANDed with the input 
  pin. 
  bits 5-7 = Unused 
  KeyCounter (56 bits) 
  The value of the key currently being checked The KeyCounter is updated very 
  frequently (i.e., once per key tested). A unique KeyCounter value is assigned 
  to every search unit. When the search unit halts after a match, KeyCounter has 
  already been incremented to the next key; the match was on the previous key. 
  SearchCommandAndStatus (8 bits) 
  The bits in SearchStatus describe the current search state of a specific 
  search unit. A unique SearchStatus register is allocated for each search unit. 
  Bits of SearchStatus are allocated as follows: 



  2-4 
  bit 0 = SearchActive 
  Indicates whether the search is currently halted (0=halted, 1=active). The 
  computer sets this bit to begin a search, and it is cleared by the search unit 
  if a matching candidate key is found. The host computer checks the status of 
  this bit periodically and, if it is zero, reads out the key then restarts the 
  search. (See also ChipAllActive and BoardAllActive in the SearchInfo 
  register.) 
  bit 1 = CiphertextSelector 
  Indicates whether the search engine is currently checking Ciphertext0 or 
  Ciphertext1. (0=Ciphertext0, 1=Ciphertext1). If this bit is clear, the search 
  engine decrypts Ciphertext0 and either sets CiphertextSelector to 1 (if the 
  plaintext passes the checks) or increments KeyCounter (if the plaintext does 
  not pass). If this bit is set, the search engine decrypts Ciphertext1 and 
  either sets SearchActive to 0 (if the plaintext passes the checks) or sets 
  CiphertextSelector to 0 and increments KeyCounter (if the plaintext does not 
  pass). 
  bits 2-7 = Unused 
  Commands 
  In order to be able to address each search unit separately, each can be 
  addressed uniquely by the combination of its location on the chip, the 
  location of the chip on the board, and board's identifier. The BoardID is 
  interpreted off-chip; each chip has a board select pin, which notifies the 
  chip when the board has been selected. Chip ID matching is done inside each 
  ASIC; the ID pins of the ASIC are wired to the chip's ID. 
  All commands are originated by the computer go via a bus which carries 8 bits 
  for BoardID/ChipID/Register address, 8 bits for data, and a few additional 
  bits for controls . 
  To do a search, the host computer will program the search units as shown in 
  Figure 2-2. (N is the total number of search units, numbered from 0 to N-1, 
  each with a unique BoardID/ChipID/Register address.) 
  Search Unit Operation 
  Each search unit contains a DES engine, which performs DES on two 32-bit 
  registers L/R using the key value in KeyCounter. Each search unit goes through 
  the process detailed in Figure 2-3, and never needs to halt. If registers are 
  updated during the middle of this process, the output is meaningless (which is 
  fine, since an incorrect output is statistically almost certain to not be a 
  match). 



  2-5 
        Figure 2-2: Example algorithm for programming 
        the search array using host computer 
        This is a very simple algorithm intended only as an example. The actual 
        software will use more intelligent search techniques, using the 
        BoardAllActive and ChipAllActive lines. 
        Load Ciphertext0, Ciphertext1, PlaintextXorMask, PlaintextByteMask, 
        PlaintextVector, and SearchInfo into each chip. 
        For i = 0 upto N-1 
          Set SearchStatus in search unit i to 0 while loading the key. 
          Set KeyCounter of search unit i to ((256)(i) / N). 
          Set SearchStatus in search unit i to 1 to enable SearchActive. 
        EndFor 
        While correct key has not been found: 
          For i = 0 upto N-1: 
            Read SearchStatus from search unit i.
            Check SearchActive bit. 
            If SearchActive is set to 0: 
              Read KeyCounter from search unit i. 
              Subtract 1 from the low 32 bits of the key. 
              Perform a DES operation at the local computer to check the key. If 
              the key is correct, the search is done. 
              Set the SearchActive bit of SearchStatus to restart the search. 
            EndIf 
          EndFor 
        EndWhile 


  Sample Programming Descriptions 
  This section describes how the system will be programmed for some typical 
  operations. 
  Known ciphertext/plaintext (ECB, CBC, etc.) 
  If a complete ciphertext/plaintext block is known, this mode is used. This 
  works for most DES modes (ECB, CBC, counter, etc.), but does require a full 
  plaintext/ ciphertext pair. 
  PlaintextVector 
  For this search, there are 8 (or fewer) unique plaintext bytes in the known 
  plaintext. The bits corresponding to these bytes are set in PlaintextVector, 
  but all other bits are set to 0. 



  2-6 
        Figure 2-3: Search unit operation 
        1. If CiphertextSelector is 0, then Let L/R = Ciphertext0. 
        If CiphertextSelector is 1, then Let L/R = Ciphertext1. 
        2. Decrypt L/R using the key in KeyCounter, producing a candidate 
        plaintext in L/R. 
        3. If ExtraXOR is 1, then Let L = L XOR R.
        If CiphertextSelector is 0, then 
          Let L/R = L/R XOR PlaintextXorMask. 
        If CiphertextSelector is 1 and UseCBC is 1, then: 
          Let L/R = L/R XOR Ciphertext0. 
        4. If SearchActive = 1 AND ( 
        (PlaintextByteMask[0x80] = 0 AND PlaintextVector[byte 0 of L] is 0) OR 
        (PlaintextByteMask[0x40] = 0 AND PlaintextVector[byte 1 of L] is 0) OR 
        (PlaintextByteMask[0x20] = 0 AND PlaintextVector[byte 2 of L] is 0) OR 
        (PlaintextByteMask[0x10] = 0 AND PlaintextVector[byte 3 of L] is 0) OR 
        (PlaintextByteMask[0x08] = 0 AND PlaintextVector[byte 0 of R] is 0) OR 
        (PlaintextByteMask[0x04] = 0 AND PlaintextVector[byte 1 of R] is 0) OR 
        (PlaintextByteMask[0x02] = 0 AND PlaintextVector[byte 2 of R] is 0) OR 
        (PlaintextByteMask[0x01] = 0 AND PlaintextVector[byte 3 of R] is 0)) 
        then: 
          Let CiphertextSelector = 0. 
          Increment KeyCounter. 
        else 
          If CiphertextSelector is 1 then Let SearchActive = 0. 
          Let CiphertextSelector = 1. 
        5. Go to step 1. 


  Ciphertext0 
  Equals the ciphertext block. 
  Ciphertext1 
  Equals the ciphertext block. 
  SearchInfo 
  UseCBC and ExtraXOR are both set to 0. 
  PlaintextByteMask 
  Set to 0x00 (all bytes used). 



  2-7 
  PlaintextXorMask 
  Set to 0x0000000000000000. 
  Because the plaintext byte order does not matter, there are 8 acceptable 
  values for each ciphertext byte, or 88 = 224 = 16.7 million possible 
  ciphertexts which will satisfy the search criteria. The probability that an 
  incorrect ciphertext will pass is 224 / 264, so over a search of 255 keys 
  there will be an average of (255)( 224 / 264), or 32768 false positives which 
  will need to be rejected by the controlling computer. Because the Ciphertext0 
  and Ciphertext1 selections are identical, any false positives that pass the 
  first test will also pass the second test. (The performance penalty is 
  negligible; the search system will do two DES operations on each of the 32768 
  false positive keys, but only one DES operation on all other incorrect keys.) 
  ASCII text (ECB or CBC) 
  A minimum of two adjacent ciphertexts (16 bytes total) are required for 
  ASCII-only attacks. 
  PlaintextVector 
  Set only the bits containing acceptable ASCII characters. For normal text, 
  this would normally include 55 of the 256 possible characters occur (10=line 
  feed, 13=carriage return, 32=space, 65-90=capital letters, and 
  97-122=lowercase letters). 
  Ciphertext0 
  Equals the first ciphertext. 
  Ciphertext1 
  Equals the second ciphertext. 
  SearchInfo 
  UseCBC is set to 0 if ECB, or set to 1 if the ciphertext was produced using 
  CBC. ExtraXOR is set to 0. 
  PlaintextByteMask 
  Set to 0x00 (all bytes used). 
  PlaintextXorMask 
  Set to 0x0000000000000000 for ECB, to IV for CBC. 
  The probability that the two (random) candidate plaintexts produced by an 
  incorrect key will contain only the ASCII text characters listed above is 
  (55/256)16. In a search, there will thus be an average of 255 (55/256)16 = 
  742358 false positives which need to be rejected by the computer. For one key 
  in about 220,000, the first check will pass and an extra DES will be required. 
  (The time for these extra DES operations is insignificant.) Idle time lost 
  while waiting for false positives to be cleared is also insignificant. If the 
  computer checks each search unit's SearchActive flag once per second, a total 
  of 0.5 search unit seconds will be wasted for every 



  2-8 
  false positive, or a total of 103 search-unit hours, out of about 4 million 
  search-unit hours for the whole search. 
  When programming CBC mode, note that the PlaintextXorMask must be set to the 
  IV (or the previous ciphertext, if the ciphertext being attacked is not in the 
  first block). 
  Matt Blaze's Challenge 
  The goal is to find a case where all plaintext bytes are equal and all 
  ciphertext bytes are equal. 
  PlaintextVector 
  Set only bit 0. 
  Ciphertext0 
  Set to a fixed value with all bytes equal 
  Ciphertext1 
  Same as Ciphertext0. 
  SearchInfo 
  UseCBC is set to 0. ExtraXOR is set to 1. 
  PlaintextByteMask 
  Set to 0x0F (only left half examined). 
  PlaintextXorMask 
  Set to 0x0000000000000000. 
  If the right and left half are equal, as must be the case if all plaintext 
  bytes are the same, then when the ExtraXOR bit's status causes the L=L XOR R 
  step, L will become equal to 0. The plaintext byte mask selects only the left 
  half and the PlaintextVector makes sure the 4 bytes are 0. 
  False positives occur whenever L=R, or with one key in 232. Because this 
  search is not guaranteed to terminate after 256 operations, the average time 
  is 256 (not 255). The number of false positives is expected to be 256 / 232 = 
  224 = 16.8 million. Each search unit will thus find a false positive every 232 
  keys on average, or about once every half hour. At 1 second polling of search 
  units, (0.5)(16.8 million)/3600 = 2333 search unit hours will be idle (still 
  under 1% of the total). The host computer will need to do the 16.8 million DES 
  operations (on average), but even a fairly poor DES implementation can do this 
  in just a few minutes. 



  2-9 
  Scalability and Performance 
  The architecture was intended to find DES keys in less than 10 days on 
  average. The performance of the initial implementation is specified in Figure 
  2-4. Faster results can be easily obtained with increased hardware; doubling 
  the amount of hardware will halve the time per result. Within the design, 
  boards of keysearch ASICs can be added and removed easily, making it simple to 
  make smaller or larger systems, where larger systems cost more but find 
  results more quickly. Larger systems will have additional power and cooling 
  requirements.

  Host Computer Software 
  Cryptography Research will write the following software: 
  Simulation 
  Cryptography Research will develop software to generate test vectors for the 
  chip for testing before the design is sent to the fab. This software will test 
  all features on the chip and all modes of operation. This program will have a 
  simple command line interface. 
  Host computer 
  The host computer software program will implement the standard search tasks of 
  breaking a known plaintext, breaking encrypted ASCII text (ECB and CBC modes), 
  and solving the Matt Blaze challenge. These programs will be written in 



  2-10 
  standard ANSI C, except for platform-specific I/O code. The host program will 
  also have a test mode, which loads search units with tasks that are known to 
  halt reasonably quickly (e.g., after searching a few million keys) and 
  verifies the results to detect any failed parts. (The software will include 
  the capability of bypassing bad search units during search operations.) Users 
  who wish to perform unusual searches will need to add a custom function to 
  determining whether candidate keys are actually correct and recompile the 
  code. 
  The initial version of this program will have a simple command line interface 
  and will be written for DOS. A Linux port will also be written, but may not be 
  ready by the initial target completion date. (Because the only 
  platform-specific code will be the I/O functions, it should be very easy to 
  port to any platform with an appropriate compiler.) Software programs will 
  identify the participants in the project (AWT, EFF, and Cryptography 
  Research). 
  Cryptography Research will also produce a version with a prettier user 
  interface to make the demonstration more elegant (platform-to-be-determined). 
  All software and source code will be placed in the public domain.

  _________________ 
  Pre-ANSI C can be supported if required. Any GUI code will probably be written 
  in C++ . 



  2-11 
  CiphertextSelector 
  A register used to select the current ciphertext being attacked. The selector 
  is needed because a single DES engine needs to be able to test two ciphertexts 
  to determine whether both are acceptable matches before deciding that a key is 
  good match. 
  DES 
  The Data Encryption Standard. 
  ExtraXOR 
  A register to make the search units perform an extra operation which XORs the 
  right and left halves of the result together. This is used to add support for 
  Matt Blaze's DES challenge. 
  Host computer 
  The computer that controls the DES search array. 
  KeyCounter 
  Each search unit has a KeyCounter register which contains the current key 
  being searched. These registers are each 7 bytes long, to hold a 56-bit key. 
  Plaintext 
  Unencrypted data corresponding to a ciphertext. 
  PlaintextByteMask 
  An 8-bit register used to mask off plaintext bytes. This is used to mask off 
  bytes in the plaintext whose values aren't known or are too variable to list 
  in the PlaintextVector. 
  PlaintextVector 
  A 256-bit register used to specify which byte values can be present in valid 
  plaintexts. It is the host computer's responsibility to ensure that only a 
  reasonable number of bits are set in the PlaintextVector; setting too many 
  will cause the DES search units to halt too frequently. 
  PlaintextXorMask 
  A 64-bit register XORed onto the value derived by decrypting ciphertext 0. 
  Normally this mask is either zero or set to the CBC mode initialization vector 
  (IV). 
  SearchActive 
  A bit for each search unit which indicates whether it is currently searching, 
  or whether it has stopped at a candidate key. Stopped search units can be 
  restarted by loading a key which does not halt and resetting this bit. 
  SearchInfo 
  A register containing miscellaneous information about how DES results should 
  be post-processed and also indicating whether any search units on the chip or 
  on the 



  2-12 
  board have halted. 
  UseCBC 
  A bit in SearchInfo which directs the search engine to do CBC-mode 
  post-processing after decryption (e.g., XOR the decryption of ciphertext1 with 
  ciphertext0 to produce plaintext1).

  Scanning the Source Code 
  In this chapter: 
    The Politics of Cryptographic Source Code 
    The Paper Publishing Exception 
    Scanning 
    Bootstrapping 
  The next few chapters of this book contain specially formatted versions of the 
  documents that we wrote to design the DES Cracker. These documents are the 
  primary sources of our research in brute-force cryptanalysis, which other 
  researchers would need in order to duplicate or validate our research results. 

  The Politics of Cryptographic Source Code 
  Since we are interested in the rapid progress of the science of cryptography, 
  as well as in educating the public about the benefits and dangers of 
  cryptographic technology, we would have preferred to put all the information 
  in this book on the World Wide Web. There it would be instantly accessible to 
  anyone worldwide who has an interest in learning about cryptography. 
  Unfortunately the authors live and work in a country whose policies on 
  cryptography have been shaped by decades of a secrecy mentality and covert 
  control. Powerful agencies which depend on wiretapping to do their jobs--as 
  well as to do things that aren't part of their jobs, but which keep them in 
  power--have compromised both the Congress and several Executive Branch 
  agencies. They convinced Congress to pass unconstitutional laws which limit 
  the freedom of researchers--such as ourselves--to publish their work. (All too 
  often, convincing Congress to violate the Constitution is like convincing a 
  cat to follow a squeaking can opener, but that doesn't excuse the agencies for 
  doing it.) They pressured agencies such as the Commerce Department, State 
  Department, and Department of Justice to not only subvert their oaths of 
  office by supporting these unconstitutional laws, but to act as front-men in 
  their repressive censorship scheme, creating unconstitutional regulations and 
  enforcing them against ordinary researchers and 
  4-1 



  4-2 
  authors of software. 
  The National Security Agency is the main agency involved, though they seem to 
  have recruited the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the last several years. 
  From the outside we can only speculate what pressures they brought to bear on 
  these other parts of the government. The FBI has a long history of illicit 
  wiretapping, followed by use of the information gained for blackmail, 
  including blackmail of Congressmen and Presidents. FBI spokesmen say that was 
  "the old bad FBI" and that all that stuff has been cleaned up after J. Edgar 
  Hoover died and President Nixon was thrown out of office. But these agencies 
  still do everything in their power to prevent ordinary citizens from being 
  able to examine their activities, e.g. stonewalling those of us who try to use 
  the Freedom of Information Act to find out exactly what they are doing. 
  Anyway, these agencies influenced laws and regulations which now make it 
  illegal for U.S. crypto researchers to publish their results on the World Wide 
  Web (or elsewhere in electronic form). 
  The Paper Publishing Exception 
  Several cryptographers have brought lawsuits against the U.S. Government 
  because their work has been censored by the laws restricting the export of 
  cryptography. (The Electronic Frontier Foundation is sponsoring one of these 
  suits, Bernstein v. Department of Justice, et al ).* One result of bringing 
  these practices under judicial scrutiny is that some of the most egregious 
  past practices have been eliminated. 
  For example, between the 1970s and early 1990s, NSA actually did threaten 
  people with prosecution if they published certain scientific papers, or put 
  them into libraries. They also had a "voluntary" censorship scheme for people 
  who were willing to sign up for it. Once they were sued, the Government 
  realized that their chances of losing a court battle over the export controls 
  would be much greater if they continued censoring books, technical papers, and 
  such. 
  Judges understand books. They understand that when the government denies 
  people the ability to write, distribute, or sell books, there is something 
  very fishy going on. The government might be able to pull the wool over a few 
  judges' eyes about jazzy modern technologies like the Internet, floppy disks, 
  fax machines, telephones, and such. But they are unlikely to fool the judges 
  about whether it's constitutional to jail or punish someone for putting ink 
  onto paper in this free country.

  4-3 
  Therefore, the last serious update of the cryptography export controls (in 
  1996) made it explicit that these regulations do not attempt to regulate the 
  publication of information in books (or on paper in any format). They waffled 
  by claiming that they "might" later decide to regulate books--presumably if 
  they won all their court cases -- but in the meantime, the First Amendment of 
  the United States Constitution is still in effect for books, and we are free 
  to publish any kind of cryptographic information in a book. Such as the one in 
  your hand. 
  Therefore, cryptographic research, which has traditionally been published on 
  paper, shows a trend to continue publishing on paper, while other forms of 
  scientific research are rapidly moving online. 
  The Electronic Frontier Foundation has always published most of its 
  information electronically. We produce a regular electronic newsletter, 
  communicate with our members and the public largely by electronic mail and 
  telephone, and have built a massive archive of electronically stored 
  information about civil rights and responsibilities, which is published for 
  instant Web or FTP access from anywhere in the world. 
  We would like to publish this book in the same form, but we can't yet, until 
  our court case succeeds in having this research censorship law overturned. 
  Publishing a paper book's exact same information electronically is seriously 
  illegal in the United States, if it contains cryptographic software. Even 
  communicating it privately to a friend or colleague, who happens to not live 
  in the United States, is considered by the government to be illegal in 
  electronic form. 
  The U.S. Department of Commerce has officially stated that publishing a World 
  Wide Web page containing links to foreign locations which contain 
  cryptographic software "is not an export that is subject to the Export 
  Administration Regulations (EAR)."* This makes sense to us--a quick reductio 
  ad absurdum shows that to make a ban on links effective, they would also have 
  to ban the mere mention of foreign Universal Resource Locators. URLs are 
  simple strings of characters, like http://www.eff.org; it's unlikely that any 
  American court would uphold a ban on the mere naming of a location where some 
  piece of information can be found. 
  Therefore, the Electronic Frontier Foundation is free to publish links to 
  where electronic copies of this book might exist in free countries. If we ever 
  find out about such an overseas electronic version, we will publish such a 
  link to it from the page at 
  http://www.eff.org/pub/Privacy/Crypto_misc/DESCracker/.

  control regulations. 



  Scanning 
  When printing this book, we used tools from Pretty Good Privacy, Inc (which 
  has since been merged into Network Associates, Inc.). They built a pretty good 
  set of tools for scanning source code, and for printing source code for 
  scanning. The easiest way to handle the documents we are publishing in this 
  book is to use their tools and scanning instructions. 
  PGP published the tools in a book, naturally, called "Tools for Publishing 
  Source Code via OCR", by Colin Plumb, Mark H. Weaver, and Philip R. 
  Zimmermann, ISBN # 1-891064-02-9. The book was printed in 1997, and is sold by 
  Printers Inc. Bookstore, 301 Castro St, Mountain View, California 94041 USA; 
  phone +1650 961 8500; http://www.pibooks.com. 
  The tools and instructions from the OCR Tools book are now available on the 
  Internet as well as in PGP's book. See http://www.pgpi.com/project/, and 
  follow the link to "proof-reading utilities". If that doesn't work because the 
  pages have been moved or rearranged, try working your way down from the 
  International PGP page, http://www.pgpi.com. 
  PGP's tools produce per-line and per-page checksums, and make normally 
  invisible characters like tabs and multiple spaces explicit. Once you obtain 
  these tools, we strongly suggest reading the textual material in the book, or 
  the equivalent README file in the online tool distribution. It contains very 
  detailed instructions for scanning and proofreading listings like those in 
  this book. The instructions that follow in this chapter are a very abbreviated 
  version. 
  The first two parts of converting these listings to electronic form is to scan 
  in images of the pages, then convert the images into an approximation of the 
  text on the pages. The first part is done by a mechanical scanner; the second 
  is done by an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) program. You can sometimes 
  rent time at a local "copy shop" on a computer that has both a scanner and an 
  OCR program. 
  When scanning the sources, we suggest "training" your OCR program by scanning 
  the test-file pages that follow, and some of the listings, and correcting the 
  OCR program's idea of what the text actually said. The details of how to do 
  this will depend on your particular OCR program. But if you straighten it out 
  first about the shapes of the particular characters and symbols that we're 
  using, the process of correcting the errors in the rest of the pages will be 
  much easier. 
  Some unique characters are used in the listings; train the OCR program to 
  convert them as follows: 



  4-5 
    Right pointing triangle (used for tabs) - currency symbol (byte value octal 
    244) 
    Tiny centered triangle "dot" (used for multiple spaces) - center dot or 
    bullet (byte value octal 267) 
    Form feed - yen (byte value octal 245) 
    Big black square (used for line continuation) - pilcrow or paragraph symbol 
    (byte value octal 266). 
  Once you've scanned and OCR'd the pages, you can run them through PGP's tools 
  to detect and correct errors, and to produce clean online copies. 
  Bootstrapping 
  By the courtesy of Philip R. Zimmermann and Network Associates, to help people 
  who don't have the PGP OCR tools, we have included PGP's bootstrap and 
  bootstrap2 pages. (The word bootstrap refers to the concept of "pulling 
  yourself up by your bootstraps", i.e. getting something started without any 
  outside help.) If you can scan and OCR the pages in some sort of reasonable 
  way, you can then extract the corrected files using just this book and a Perl 
  interpreter. It takes more manual work than if you used the full set of PGP 
  tools. 
  The first bootstrap program is one page of fairly easy to read Perl code. Scan 
  in this page, as carefully as you can: you'll have to correct it by hand. Make 
  a copy of the file that results from the OCR, and manually delete the 
  checksums, so that it will run as a Perl script. Then run this Perl script 
  with the OCR result (with checksums) as the argument. If you've corrected it 
  properly, it will run and produce a clean copy of itself, in a file called 
  bootstrap. (Make sure none of your files have that name.) If you haven't 
  corrected it properly, the perl script will die somehow and you'll have to 
  compare it to the printed text to see what you missed. 
  When the bootstrap script runs, it checks the checksum on each line of its 
  input file. For any line that is incorrect, the script drops you into a text 
  editor (set by the EDITOR environment variable) so you can fix that line. When 
  you exit the editor, it starts over again. 
  Once the bootstrap script has produced a clean version of itself, you can run 
  it against the scanned and OCR'd copy of the bootstrap2 page. Correct it the 
  same way, line by line until bootstrap doesn't complain. This should leave you 
  with a clean copy of bootstrap2. 
  The bootstrap2 script is what you'll use to scan in the rest of the book. It 
  works like the bootstrap script, but it can detect more errors by using the 
  page 



  4-6 
  checksum. Again, it won't correct most errors itself, but will drop you into 
  an editor to correct them manually. (If you want automatic error correction, 
  you have to get the PGP book.) 
  All the scannable listings in this book are in the public domain, except the 
  test-file, bootstrap, and bootstrap2 pages, which are copyrighted, but which 
  Network Associates permits you to freely copy. So none of the authors have put 
  restrictions on your right to copy their listings for friends, reprint them, 
  scan them in, publish them, use them in products, etc. However, if you live in 
  an unfree country, there may be restrictions on what you can do with the 
  listings or information once you have them. Check with your local thought 
  police.

  This paper was presented at Eurocrypt 1987 by Yvo Desmedt and Jean-Jacques 
  Quisquater, under the title "An Exhaustive Key Search Machine Breaking One 
  Million DES Keys". We publish it here for the first time, since no proceedings 
  were made. It points out some research directions in parallel brute force 
  codebreaking that are still useful today. 
  Abstract 
  The DES is in the commercial and industrial world the most used 
  cryptoalgorithm. A realistic exhaustive key search machine will be proposed 
  which breaks thousands of keys each hour, when DES is used in its standard 8 
  byte modes to protect privacy. Also authenticity protection with DES is 
  sometimes insecure. 
  Introduction 
  The DES is the NBS* and ANSI+ standard for encryption. It has been proposed to 
  become an ISO# standard, under the name DEA1. From the beginning Diffie and 
  Hellman mentioned that one DES key could be broken under a known plaintext 
  attack using an exhaustive keysearch machine. However the design was 
  criticized because practical problems as size and power dissipation were not 
  taken into

  consideration. Hoornaert* proposed last year a realistic exhaustive keysearch 
  machine, which solved all practical problems. Instead of breaking DES in half 
  a day (as in the Diffie-Hellman machine), the cheap version ($1 million) needs 
  maximum 4 weeks to find the key. In practice however companies or secret 
  agencies want to break several keys at once. Indeed for doing industrial 
  espionage, companies want to break as many communications as possible of their 
  main competitors. Secret agencies want to be able to eavesdrop all 
  communications and to follow up industrial developments in other countries 
  which may be used for military purposes. The above machine is unpractical or 
  expensive for this purpose. Instead of using thousands of machines for 
  breaking thousands of keys, one modified machine is enough. 
  The basic idea 
  At first sight if one wants to break one million keys with an exhaustive 
  machine one needs one million pairs (plaintext,ciphertext)=(Mi,Ci) and do the 
  job for each different pair. If all these pairs have the same plaintext M, the 
  exhaustive machine can do the same job by breaking all these one million 
  ciphertexts, as in the case it had only to break one. This assumption is very 
  realistic, indeed in letters some pattern as e.g."Yours Sincerely" are common. 
  For all standard+ 8 bytes modes a partially known plaintext attack is 
  sufficient. In the case of ECB a ciphertext only attack is sufficient. Indeed 
  the most frequent combination of 8 bytes can easily be detected and used. 
  Evidently more machines can handle more different plaintext patterns. So, a 
  few machines can break millions of keys. The number of different patterns can 
  be reduced by using a chosen plaintext attack! 
  Details of such a machine 
  Although we did not built it, in this section sufficient details are given to 
  show that such a machine is feasible. The machine will be based on a small 
  extension of the DES chips used in Hoornaert's machine. We will call the 
  ciphertexts for which one wants to break the key: "desired" ciphertexts. In 
  one machine, each of the (e.g.) 25 thousand DES chips will calculate 
  ciphertexts for variable keys starting from the same 8 byte "plaintext" 
  pattern. The machine has to verify if such a ciphertext is the same as some 
  "desired" ciphertext. If so, it has to communicate the corresponding key to 
  the Key Handling Machine (KHM) and the "number" of the "desired" ciphertext. 
  However each used DES chip generates each second about

  one million pairs (ciphertext, key). This gives a major communication problem. 
  Indeed all this information (about 110Mbit/sec.= (56 key bits + 64 ciphertext 
  bits) x 1M DES/sec.) cannot be communicated constantly outside the chip. To 
  avoid this communication problem, the chip will internally exclude ciphertexts 
  which certainly are not equal to a "desired" ciphertext. So only a fraction 
  has to be communicated to the outside world. Hereto the "desired" ciphertexts 
  were previously ordered based on their first 20 bits, which are used as 
  address of the desired ciphertexts. If more than one of these "desired" 
  ciphertexts have the same 20 first bits then one of them will later be 
  transferred to the exhaustive machine. The others will be put on a waiting 
  list. In the exhaustive machine bits of the desired ciphertexts are spread in 
  RAMs, as explained later, using the 20 first bits as address. Each extended 
  DES chip is put on a hybrid circuit together with 4 RAMs of 1Mbit and a 
  refresh controller (see also fig. 1[not provided]). For each enumerated key 
  the DES chip communicates the 20 first bits of the corresponding generated 
  ciphertext to the RAMs as address. The 4 bits information stored in the RAMs 
  correspond to the next 4 bits of the desired ciphertexts. The RAMs communicate 
  to the modified DES chip these 4 bits. Only if these 4 bits are equal to the 
  corresponding ones in the generated ciphertext, the generated pair 
  (ciphertext, key) is communicated outside the DES chip to a local bus (see 
  fig. 1). So in average the communication rate is reduced, by excluding the 
  ciphertexts which are certainly not desired. About 10 of these hybrids are put 
  on a small PCB. A custom designed chip checks the next 10 bits (the bits 25 
  till 34) of the ciphertexts using the same idea as for the 4 bits (the bits 21 
  till 24). Hereto 10 RAMs each of 1Mbit are used, the address is again the 
  first 20 bits of the generated ciphertext. Only if the check succeeds the pair 
  (ciphertext, key) is communicated to the outside world via a global bus. This 
  reduces the communication between the local bus and the global bus with a 
  factor 1000. About 2500 similar PCBs are put in the machine. The last 30 bits 
  of the ciphertext are checked further on. Hereto similar hardware controls 
  several PCBs. Finally a small machine can do the final check. The machine KHM 
  checks the correctness of the key on other (plaintext, ciphertext) pairs or on 
  the redundancy in the language. Once each (e.g.) hour the machine KHM will 
  update the broken keys and put the ones which are on the waiting list into the 
  exhaustive machine (if possible). Suppose that one hybrid cost $80, then the 
  price of $3 million (25,000 x hybrid + custom chips + PCBs + etc) for this 
  machine is realistic.

  Obtained results and remarks 
  The described machine breaks about one million keys in 4 weeks, or in average 
  about 3000 keys each hour. By updating the broken keys better results can be 
  obtained.* Practical problems as buffering, synchronization, MTBF, power 
  dissipation, size, reloading of the RAMs and so on are solved by the author. 
  Optimizations under several circumstances and variants of the machine are 
  possible. In view of the existing rumors that a trapdoor was built in DES by 
  NSA, the feasibility of this machine shows that a trapdoor was not needed in 
  order to break it. Old RAM technology allowed to design similar (or larger) 
  machines which break less keys (e.g. thirty-two thousand keys). This attack 
  can be avoided if the users of DES use the CFB one byte mode appropriately, or 
  use new modes+ or triple encryption with two different keys. DES-like 
  algorithms can be designed which are more secure against the described attack 
  and which use a key of only 48 bit, and which have the same 
  encryption/decryption speed as DES (if used with fixed key).# The protection 
  of the authenticity of (e.g. short) messages with DES is sometimes insecure. 
  These results combined with the above one, shows that the authentication of 
  standardized messages with DES may be worthless. Remark finally that the DES 
  chip used in this machine does not use the state of the art of VLSI. Indeed 
  about only 10,000 transistors are used in it. Megabits RAMs are easily 
  available. 
  Conclusion 
  Every important company or secret agency over the world can easily build such 
  a machine. Because it is not excluded that such machines are already in use by 
  these organizations, the author advises the users to be careful using DES. 
  Because the most used modes are breakable, the users have to modify their 
  hard- or software in a mode which avoids this attack. Meanwhile only 
  low-sensitive information can be transmitted with DES. If the authenticity of 
  the messages is protected with DES under its standardized use, short messages 
  have to be enlarged.

  Efficient DES Key Search An Update by Michael J. Wiener 
  In this chapter: 
    Advancing Technology 
    Programmable Hardware 
    Conclusion 
  An exciting moment in the history of DES was reached in June 1997 when a group 
  coordinated by Rocke Verser solved RSA Data Security's DES challenge by 
  exhaustive key search on a large number of computers. This result was useful 
  because it served to underscore in a public way how vulnerable DES has become. 
  However, it may also have left the false impression that one cannot do much 
  better than attacking DES in software with a large distributed effort. The 
  design of DES is such that it is fairly slow in software, but is compact and 
  fast when implemented in hardware. As a result, using software to attack DES 
  gives poor performance compared to what can be achieved in hardware. This 
  applies not only to DES, but also to most other block ciphers, attacks on hash 
  functions, and attacks on elliptic curve cryptosystems. Avoiding efficient 
  hardware-based attacks requires the use of algorithms with sufficiently long 
  keys, such as triple-DES, 128-bit RC5,* and CAST-128.+ 
  In this article we assess the cost of DES key search using hardware methods 
  and examine the effectiveness of some proposed methods for thwarting attacks

  Advancing Technology 
  The best known way to attack DES is to simply try all of the possible 56-bit 
  keys until the correct key is found. On average, one expects to go through 
  about half of the key space. In 1993, a design for an exhaustive DES key 
  search machine including a detailed chip design was published.* A $1 million 
  version of this machine used 57600 key search chips, each capable of testing 
  50 million keys per second. Overall, the machine could find a DES key in, on 
  average, three and a half hours. 
  About four and a half years have passed since this design was completed, and 
  according to Moore's Law, processing speeds should have doubled three times in 
  that period. Of course, estimating in this fashion is a poor substitute for 
  the careful analysis and design effort that went into the earlier design. The 
  original chip design was done in a 0.8 micron CMOS process, and with the 
  geometries available today, it is possible to fit four instances of the 
  original design into the same silicon area. In keeping with the conservative 
  approach to estimates in the 1993 paper, we assume here that the updated key 
  search chip's clock speed would increase to only 75 MHz from the original 50 
  MHz, making the modern version of the chip six times faster for the same cost. 
  It is interesting to note that just 21 of these chips would give the same key 
  searching power as the entire set of computers used by the team who solved the 
  DES challenge. 
  Today's version of the $1 million machine could find a DES key in, on average, 
  about 35 minutes (one-sixth of 3.5 hours). This time scales linearly with the 
  amount of money spent as shown in the following table. 
        Key Search Machine Cost Expected Search Time 
        $10,000    2.5 days
        $100,000    6 hours
        $1,000,000    35 minutes
        $10,000,000    3.5 minutes

  Note that the costs listed in the table do not include the cost to design the 
  chip and boards for the machine. Because the one-time costs could be as high 
  as half a million dollars, it does not make much sense to build the cheaper 
  versions of the machine, unless several are built for different customers. 
  This key search engine is designed to recover a DES key given a 
  plaintext-ciphertext pair for the standard electronic-codebook (ECB) mode of 
  DES. However, the machine can also handle the following modes without 
  modification: cipher-block

  chaining (CBC), 64-bit cipher feedback (CFB), and 64- bit output feedback 
  (OFB). In the case of OFB, two consecutive plaintexts are needed. The chip 
  design can be modified to handle two other popular modes of DES, 1-bit and 
  8-bit CFB, at the cost of a slightly more expensive chip. Fewer chips could be 
  purchased for a $1 million machine causing the expected key search time to go 
  up to 40 minutes for all modes, except 1-bit CFB, which would take 80 minutes, 
  on average. 
  Programmable Hardware 
  The costs associated with chip design can present a significant barrier to 
  smalltime attackers and hobbyists. An alternative which has much lower 
  start-up costs is the use of programmable hardware. One such type of 
  technology is the Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). One can design a 
  circuit on a PC and download it to a board holding FPGAs for execution. In a 
  report in early 1996,* it was estimated that $50000 worth of FPGAs could 
  recover a DES key in, on average, four months. This is considerably slower 
  than what can be achieved with a chip design, but is much more accessible to 
  those who are not well funded. 
  Another promising form of programmable hardware is the Complex Programmable 
  Logic Device (CPLD). CPLDs offer less design freedom and tend to be cheaper 
  than FPGAs, but the nature of key search designs seems to make them suitable 
  for CPLDs. Further research is needed to assess whether CPLDs are useful for 
  DES key search. 
  Avoiding Known Plaintext 
  The designs described to this point have relied on the attacker having some 
  known plaintext. Usually, a single 8-byte block is sufficient. One method of 
  preventing attacks that has been suggested is to avoid having any known 
  plaintext. This can be quite difficult to achieve. Frequently, data begins 
  with fixed headers. For example, each version of Microsoft Word seems to have 
  a fixed string of bytes that each file begins with. 
  For those cases where a full block of known plaintext is not available, it is 
  possible to adapt the key search design. Suppose that information about 
  plaintext is available (e.g., ASCII character coding is used), but no full 
  block is known. Then instead of repeatedly encrypting a known plaintext and 
  comparing the result to a ciphertext, we repeatedly decrypt the ciphertext and 
  test the candidate plaintexts against our expectations. In the example where 
  we expect 7-bit ASCII plaintext, only about 1 in 256 keys will give a 
  plaintext which has the correct form. These

  keys would have to be tried on another ciphertext block. The added logic to 
  handle this would add just 10 to 20% to the cost of a key search chip. 
  Even if we only know a single bit of redundancy in each block of plaintext, 
  this is enough to cut the number of possible keys in half. About 56 such 
  blocks are needed to uniquely identify the correct key. This does not mean 
  that the run-time is 56 times greater than the known-plaintext case. On 
  average, each key is eliminated with just two decryptions. Taking into account 
  the cost of the added logic required makes the expected run-time for a $1 
  million machine about 2 hours in this case. 
  Frequent Key Changes 
  A commonly suggested way to avoid key search attacks is to change the DES key 
  frequently. The assumption here is that the encrypted information is no longer 
  useful after the key is changed, which is often an inappropriate assumption. 
  If it takes 35 minutes to find a DES key, why not change keys every 5 minutes? 
  The problem with this reasoning is that it does not take exactly 35 minutes to 
  find a key. The actual time is uniformly distributed between 0 and 70 minutes. 
  We could get lucky and find the key almost right away, or we could be unlucky 
  and take nearly 70 minutes. The attacker's probability of success in the 
  5-minute window is 5/70 = 1/14. If after each key change the attacker gives up 
  and starts on the next key, we expect success after 14 key changes or 70 
  minutes. In general, frequent key changes cost the attacker just a factor of 
  two in expected run-time, and are a poor substitute for simply using a strong 
  encryption algorithm with longer keys. 
  Conclusion 
  Using current technology, a DES key can be recovered with a custom-designed $1 
  million machine in just 35 minutes. For attackers who lack the resources to 
  design a chip and build such a machine, there are programmable forms of 
  hardware such as FPGAs and CPLDs which can search the DES key space much 
  faster than is possible using software on PCs and workstations. Attempts to 
  thwart key search attacks by avoiding known plaintext and changing keys 
  frequently are largely ineffective. The best course of action is to use a 
  strong encryption algorithm with longer keys, such as triple-DES, 128-bit RC5, 
  or CAST-128.
