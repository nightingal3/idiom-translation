"Twenty rules for writing detective stories" (1928)
(Originally published in the American Magazine (1928-sep),

(pseud. for Willard Huntington Wright)
      THE DETECTIVE story is a kind of intellectual game. It is more &#8212; it is a 
      sporting event. And for the writing of detective stories there are very 
      definite laws &#8212; unwritten, perhaps, but none the less binding; and every 
      respectable and self-respecting concocter of literary mysteries lives up 
      to them. Herewith, then, is a sort Credo, based partly on the practice of 
      all the great writers of detective stories, and partly on the promptings 
      of the honest author's inner conscience. To wit: 
         1. The reader must have equal opportunity with the detective for 
      solving the mystery. All clues must be plainly stated and described. 
         2. No willful tricks or deceptions may be placed on the reader other 
      than those played legitimately by the criminal on the detective himself. 
         3. There must be no love interest. The business in hand is to bring a 
      criminal to the bar of justice, not to bring a lovelorn couple to the 
      hymeneal altar. 
         4. The detective himself, or one of the official investigators, should 
      never turn out to be the culprit. This is bald trickery, on a par with 
      offering some one a bright penny for a five-dollar gold piece. It's false 
      pretenses. 
         5. The culprit must be determined by logical deductions &#8212; not by 
      accident or coincidence or unmotivated confession. To solve a criminal 
      problem in this latter fashion is like sending the reader on a deliberate 
      wild-goose chase, and then telling him, after he has failed, that you had 
      the object of his search up your sleeve all the time. Such an author is no 
      better than a practical joker. 
         6. The detective novel must have a detective in it; and a detective is 
      not a detective unless he detects. His function is to gather clues that 
      will eventually lead to the person who did the dirty work in the first 
      chapter; and if the detective does not reach his conclusions through an 
      analysis of those clues, he has no more solved his problem than the 
      schoolboy who gets his answer out of the back of the arithmetic. 
         7. There simply must be a corpse in a detective novel, and the deader 
      the corpse the better. No lesser crime than murder will suffice. Three 
      hundred pages is far too much pother for a crime other than murder. After 
      all, the reader's trouble and expenditure of energy must be rewarded. 
         8. The problem of the crime must he solved by strictly naturalistic 
      means. Such methods for learning the truth as slate-writing, ouija-boards, 
      mind-reading, spiritualistic se'ances, crystal-gazing, and the like, are 
      taboo. A reader has a chance when matching his wits with a rationalistic 
      detective, but if he must compete with the world of spirits and go chasing 
      about the fourth dimension of metaphysics, he is defeated ab initio. 
         9. There must be but one detective &#8212; that is, but one protagonist of 
      deduction &#8212; one deus ex machina. To bring the minds of three or four, or 
      sometimes a gang of detectives to bear on a problem, is not only to 
      disperse the interest and break the direct thread of logic, but to take an 
      unfair advantage of the reader. If there is more than one detective the 
      reader doesn't know who his codeductor is. It's like making the reader run 
      a race with a relay team. 
         10. The culprit must turn out to be a person who has played a more or 
      less prominent part in the story &#8212; that is, a person with whom the reader 
      is familiar and in whom he takes an interest. 
         11. A servant must not be chosen by the author as the culprit. This is 
      begging a noble question. It is a too easy solution. The culprit must be a 
      decidedly worth-while person &#8212; one that wouldn't ordinarily come under 
      suspicion. 
         12. There must be but one culprit, no matter how many murders are 
      committed. The culprit may, of course, have a minor helper or co-plotter; 
      but the entire onus must rest on one pair of shoulders: the entire 
      indignation of the reader must be permitted to concentrate on a single 
      black nature. 
         13. Secret societies, camorras, mafias, et al., have no place in a 
      detective story. A fascinating and truly beautiful murder is irremediably 
      spoiled by any such wholesale culpability. To be sure, the murderer in a 
      detective novel should be given a sporting chance; but it is going too far 
      to grant him a secret society to fall back on. No high-class, 
      self-respecting murderer would want such odds. 
         14. The method of murder, and the means of detecting it, must be be 
      rational and scientific. That is to say, pseudo-science and purely 
      imaginative and speculative devices are not to be tolerated in the roman 
      policier. Once an author soars into the realm of fantasy, in the Jules 
      Verne manner, he is outside the bounds of detective fiction, cavorting in 
      the uncharted reaches of adventure. 
         15. The truth of the problem must at all times be apparent &#8212; provided 
      the reader is shrewd enough to see it. By this I mean that if the reader, 
      after learning the explanation for the crime, should reread the book, he 
      would see that the solution had, in a sense, been staring him in the 
      face-that all the clues really pointed to the culprit &#8212; and that, if he 
      had been as clever as the detective, he could have solved the mystery 
      himself without going on to the final chapter. That the clever reader does 
      often thus solve the problem goes without saying. 
         16. A detective novel should contain no long descriptive passages, no 
      literary dallying with side-issues, no subtly worked-out character 
      analyses, no "atmospheric" preoccupations. such matters have no vital 
      place in a record of crime and deduction. They hold up the action and 
      introduce issues irrelevant to the main purpose, which is to state a 
      problem, analyze it, and bring it to a successful conclusion. To be sure, 
      there must be a sufficient descriptiveness and character delineation to 
      give the novel verisimilitude. 
         17. A professional criminal must never be shouldered with the guilt of 
      a crime in a detective story. Crimes by housebreakers and bandits are the 
      province of the police departments &#8212; not of authors and brilliant amateur 
      detectives. A really fascinating crime is one committed by a pillar of a 
      church, or a spinster noted for her charities. 
         18. A crime in a detective story must never turn out to be an accident 
      or a suicide. To end an odyssey of sleuthing with such an anti-climax is 
      to hoodwink the trusting and kind-hearted reader. 
         19. The motives for all crimes in detective stories should be personal. 
      International plottings and war politics belong in a different category of 
      fiction &#8212; in secret-service tales, for instance. But a murder story must 
      be kept gem&uuml;tlich, so to speak. It must reflect the reader's everyday 
      experiences, and give him a certain outlet for his own repressed desires 
      and emotions. 
         20. And (to give my Credo an even score of items) I herewith list a few 
      of the devices which no self-respecting detective story writer will now 
      avail himself of. They have been employed too often, and are familiar to 
      all true lovers of literary crime. To use them is a confession of the 
      author's ineptitude and lack of originality. (a) Determining the identity 
      of the culprit by comparing the butt of a cigarette left at the scene of 
      the crime with the brand smoked by a suspect. (b) The bogus spiritualistic 
      se'ance to frighten the culprit into giving himself away. (c) Forged 
      fingerprints. (d) The dummy-figure alibi. (e) The dog that does not bark 
      and thereby reveals the fact that the intruder is familiar. (f)The final 
      pinning of the crime on a twin, or a relative who looks exactly like the 
      suspected, but innocent, person. (g) The hypodermic syringe and the 
      knockout drops. (h) The commission of the murder in a locked room after 
      the police have actually broken in. (i) The word association test for 
      guilt. (j) The cipher, or code letter, which is eventually unraveled by 
      the sleuth.
