The Acorns and the Wildcat [Miyazawa Kenji] 

One Saturday evening, Ichiro received a curious postcard. It said:

  September 19th

  Mr. Kaneta Ichiro,
  I hop you are doing fyne. Tomoroww, we have trublesom trial, so come pleese. 
  No wepons pleese.
  From, the wildcat
The handwriting was terrible, and the ink so thick that it stuck to his fingers. 
But Ichiro was very happy. He carefully put the postcard in his school bag, and 
jumped and leapt about his house. Even after he went to bed he thought of 
nothing but the wildcatÅfs meowish face and what the troublesome trial would be 
like, and couldnÅft fall asleep until very late.

When he did wake up, it was fully morning. Going outside, the mountains around 
him stood up as if they had been made just then, and lined up under a perfectly 
blue sky. Ichiro hurried to finish his breakfast, and then, alone, climbed the 
river valley road upstream.

A clear wind whooshed and the chestnut tree scattered a rain of nuts. Ichiro 
looked up at the chestnut tree and asked, ÅgChestnut tree! Hullo, chestnut tree! 
Did the wildcat pass by?Åh

The chestnut tree quieted down some, and answered, ÅgThe wildcat? Early this 
morning he rushed by in a wagon, headed east.Åh

ÅgEast? That would be the direction IÅfm headed in. How strange. Well, IÅfll just 
try going on a little further. Thank you, chestnut tree!Åh The chestnut tree 
remained silent, and dropped another rain of nuts.

Ichiro traveled a little further and came to the Fluting Falls. The Fluting 
Falls was a white stone cliff with a small hole in its middle. Water rushed out 
of the hole with a sound like a flute, and formed a roaring waterfall in the 
valley below. Ichiro faced the falls and shouted, ÅgHullo, hullo! Fluting Falls! 
Did the wildcat pass by?Åh

The falls whistled an answer: ÅgThe wildcat? Just now he rushed by in a wagon, 
headed west.Åh

ÅgWest? ThatÅfs the direction my home is. How strange. Well, IÅfll just try going 
on a little further. Thank you, Fluting Falls!Åh The falls resumed blowing its 
flute.

Ichiro traveled a little further and came across the beech tree. Underneath it 
were numerous white mushrooms forming a strange band, playing don-don-da-DON, 
don-don-da-DON. Ichiro crouched down and asked, ÅgHullo, mushrooms! Did the 
wildcat pass by?Åh

The mushrooms answered, ÅgThe wildcat? Early this morning he rushed by in a 
wagon, headed south.Åh

Ichiro cocked his head. ÅgSouth? That would be towards those mountains. How 
strange. Well, IÅfll just try going on a little further. Thank you, mushrooms!Åh 
But the mushrooms were already busy reforming their strange band: 
Don-don-da-DON, don-don-da-DON.

Ichiro went a little further and came across a squirrel, leaping about the 
branches of a walnut tree. Ichiro held up a hand to stop it, and asked, ÅgHullo, 
squirrel! Did the wildcat pass by?Åh

The squirrel put its hand to its brow, and peering down at Ichiro answered, ÅgThe 
wildcat? Early this morning when it was still dark he rushed by in a wagon, 
headed south.Åh

ÅgThatÅfs the second person whoÅfs said that he went south. How strange. Well, IÅfll 
just try going on a little further. Thank you, squirrel!Åh But the squirrel was 
already gone. The only thing Ichiro could see was the topmost walnut tree branch 
waving, and a flash from a leaf in the beech tree next to it.

Ichiro went a little further, and the river valley road thinned and disappeared. 
A new small road appeared on the south side of the river, leading into the 
forest of pitch black nutmeg trees. Ichiro began to climb the new road. The 
nutmeg branches were blackly interlaced, and not a sliver of blue sky was 
visible. The road turned steeply uphill. Ichiro continued climbing, his face 
bright red and dripping beads of sweat. A sudden brightness hurt his eyes, and 
he found himself in a beautiful golden meadow of grasses that whispered in the 
wind. He was surrounded by the forest of magnificent olive-colored nutmeg trees.

In the middle of the meadow was a short, oddly-shaped man. He was crouched down 
and holding a leather whip, and staring silently at Ichiro. Ichiro approached 
him slowly, and stopped near him, surprised. The man had only one good eye, the 
other one solid white and twitching. He wore an odd overcoat or jacket. His legs 
were horribly bent like a goatÅfs, and his feet malformed like a paddle used for 
scooping rice. Though the man scared Ichiro a little, Ichiro stayed as calm as 
possible and asked, ÅgDo you know the wildcat?Åh

The man looked sideways at Ichiro, and twisting his mouth into a grin answered, 
ÅgSir Wildcat will be back shortly. You must be Ichiro.Åh

Ichiro was frightened, and backed up a step. ÅgThatÅfs right, IÅfm Ichiro. How do 
you know my name?Åh

The odd man grinned. ÅgSo you got the postcard?Åh

ÅgI did. ThatÅfs why IÅfm here.Åh

ÅgThe writing was very bad,Åh said the man, looking down with a sad expression.

Ichiro felt sorry for him and said, ÅgI thought the writing was quite good.Åh

The man looked pleased and began breathing heavily. His face turned red all the 
way to his ears, and he opened the neck of his kimono to let the air in.

ÅgWas the handwriting good, too?Åh he asked.

Ichiro couldnÅft help but laugh, and answered, ÅgIt was very good! IÅfll bet even a 
fifth-grader couldnÅft write so well!Åh

The man suddenly made a sour face. ÅgFifth grade? You mean fifth grade in 
elementary school?Åh

His voice sounded so weak and pitiable that Ichiro hurried to say, ÅgNo, I meant 
the fifth grade in college.Åh

The man was again pleased, and smiled so largely that his mouth seemed to cover 
his entire face. ÅgIÅfm the one that wrote that postcard!Åh

Ichiro stifled a laugh, and asked ÅgJust who are you?Åh

The man suddenly became serious. ÅgI drive the wagon for Sir Wildcat,Åh he said.

The wind whooshed, and waves spread through the grass, and the driver bowed 
deeply. Thinking this odd, Ichiro turned around and saw the wildcat standing 
there, wearing yellow silk robes and with perfectly round green eyes. Ichiro 
noticed that the wildcat did indeed have pointed ears. The wildcat made a quick 
bow. Ichiro returned the wildcatÅfs greeting. ÅgHello, there. Thank you for the 
postcard.Åh

The wildcat pulled a whisker taut, and stuck out his belly. ÅgGreetings, and 
welcome,Åh he said. ÅgIÅfve brought you here for your advice. ThereÅfs been quite 
the troublesome argument for three days now, and IÅfm stuck as judge of the 
trial. Please, take a seat and relax. The acorns should be here any minute. This 
trial comes back to bother me every year. Åg The wildcat pulled a box of 
cigarettes from his robe and stuck one in his mouth. ÅgWould you like one?Åh he 
asked, offering the box to Ichiro.

Surprised, Ichiro answered, ÅgNo thank you.Åh

The wildcat laughed, and said, ÅgRight, I suppose youÅfre a bit young, still.Åh He 
scratched a match alight, and scrunched his face as he blew out blue smoke. The 
wildcatÅfs driver stood straight at attention, but it was obvious from the tears 
in his eyes how much he was fighting his desire for one of the cigarettes.

Just then, Ichiro heard a sound like crunching salt. Surprised, he crouched down 
and saw round golden things scattered about and shining in the grass. Looking 
closely, he saw that they were acorns in red trousers, at least three hundred of 
them. They were all shouting something: Waah, waah, waah, waah.

ÅgAh, there they are. They swarm in like a bunch of ants. Hey, hurry up and ring 
the bell,Åh the wildcat shouted at the wagon driver, throwing away his cigarette. 
ÅgThe sunlight is good over here today, so cut down this grass.Åh The wagon driver 
hurried, taking a large sickle from his belt and cutting down the grass in front 
of the wildcat. The acorns came bounding from among the grass in all directions, 
glinting in the sun.

The wagon driver rang a bell, ding-a-ling-a-ling-a-ling. The ringing and dinging 
echoed through the nutmeg forest, and the golden acorns quieted a little. At 
some point the wildcat had changed into long, black robes, and had seated 
himself in a stately manner across from the acorns. Ichiro thought that the 
acorns looked like people come to pay homage to the Great Buddha of Nara. The 
driver cracked his whip two or three times: hyuuu-bang! hyuuu-bang! The acorns 
were beautiful, shining under the clear, blue sky.

ÅgThis trial has been going on for three days now,Åh said the wildcat, a little 
nervous but still speaking in a pompous voice. ÅgWhy donÅft you all just give up 
and get along?Åh

The acorns all shouted out: ÅgNo! No! Not until you agree that the acorns with 
pointed heads are the best! And that I have the most pointed head!Åh

ÅgNo, thatÅfs not right! The round acorns are the best! And IÅfm the roundest acorn 
there is!Åh

ÅgThe biggest ones are the best! And IÅfm the biggest one, so IÅfm the best!Åh

ÅgWhat are you talking about? IÅfm much bigger than you! Even the judge agreed 
with that yesterday!Åh

ÅgThatÅfs not it at all. ItÅfs height that matters! Taller is better!Åh

ÅgWhoeverÅfs best at wrestling is best! LetÅfs all wrestle to see whoÅfs best.Åh

All of them were buzzing, the mass of them like a bee hive that had been poked 
with a stick. All was chaos, and no one could be heard. The wildcat shouted, ÅgBe 
quiet! Where do you think you are? Silence, silence!Åh The driver cracked his 
whip hyuuu-bang! again, and the acorns finally quieted down. The wildcat twirled 
a whisker tight, and said, ÅgThis trial has been going on for three days now. Why 
donÅft you all just give up and get along?Åh

The acorns all shouted out: ÅgNo! No! Not until you agree that the acorns with 
pointed heads are the best!Åh

ÅgThatÅfs not right! Round ones are the best!Åh

ÅgNo, big ones are!Åh

And on and on and on, until no one could be understood. The wildcat shouted, 
ÅgSilence! Quiet! Where do you think you are? Shut up! Shut up!Åh The driver 
cracked his whip hyuuu-bang!, and the wildcat twirled a whisker tight. ÅgThis is 
already the third day of this trial. Why donÅft you all just give up and get 
along?Åh

ÅgNo! No! Ones with pointed headsÅcÅh and on and on and on.

The wildcat shouted: ÅgSilence! Quiet! Where do you think you are? Shut up! Shut 
up!Åh

The driver cracked his whip hyuuu-bang!, and the acorns fell silent. The wildcat 
spoke softly to Ichiro. ÅgDo you see? What should we do?Åh

Ichiro laughed and answered, ÅgYou should tell them something I heard in a 
sermon: That the most foolish of them, the poorest of them, the most wicked of 
them is the best.Åh

The wildcat nodded with understanding, and smugly opened the collar of his 
robes, showing the yellow silk underneath. He pronounced his judgment. ÅgVery 
well, then. Silence, now, IÅfm pronouncing judgment. The worst of you, the most 
foolish, the poorest, the most inept, the most weak-minded of you is the best.Åh

The acorns fell silent. Totally silent, and still.

The wildcat took off his black robes and, wiping the sweat from his brow, took 
IchiroÅfs hand. The driver was overjoyed as well, and cracked his whip five or 
six times, hyuuu-bang! hyuuu-hyuuu-bang!

ÅgThank you very much,Åh the wildcat said. ÅgYouÅfve brought this terrible trial to 
an end after just a minute and a half. Please, from now on I hope that you will 
become an honorary judge in my court. Please come again if I send you another 
postcard. I will reward you each time you come.Åh
ÅgCertainly. But you donÅft need to reward me.Åh

ÅgNo, you must accept your reward. My reputation depends on it. IÅfll address the 
postcards to Kaneta Ichiro, and have them sent from ÅeThe CourtÅf. Is that 
acceptable?Åh

ÅgSure, thatÅfs fine,Åh said Ichiro. The wildcat stood there for a time curling his 
whiskers and blinking his eyes, and finally seemed to come to a decision, 
saying, ÅgAnd how about if in the future, when I have need of you, on the 
postcard I will write that on the following day you must report to the court?Åh

Ichiro laughed. ÅgHmmm, that sounds a bit odd. Maybe you shouldnÅft write that.Åh

The wildcat seemed to take offense at this, and stood there looking down, 
twisting his whisker with a disappointed look on his face. Finally he recovered 
himself, and said, ÅgWell, IÅfll just keep the wording the same as before, then. 
Now, as to your reward for today. Which would you rather have? A box of golden 
acorns, or the head of a salted salmon?Åh

ÅgI would rather have the golden acorns, please.Åh

The wildcat seemed relieved that Ichiro hadnÅft chosen the salmon head, and 
called to the driver, ÅgBring a cup of acorns! If we donÅft have enough gold ones, 
mix in some gold plated ones! Hurry!Åh

The driver scooped up the acorns, and shouted ÅgThere is exactly one box full!Åh

The wildcatÅfs robes flapped in the breeze. The wildcat stretched fully up, 
closed his eyes, and said through a half-yawn, ÅgPrepare the wagon!Åh Oddly-shaped 
gray horses pulled out a wagon made from a huge white mushroom. ÅgLet me give you 
a ride home,Åh he said. They boarded the wagon as the driver loaded the box of 
acorns.

hyuuu-bang!

The wagon left the meadow. The trees and brush wavered like smoke. Ichiro looked 
at the gold acorns, and the wildcat stared vacantly off into the distance. As 
the wagon advanced the acorns lost their luster, and when it stopped they had 
become just plain brown acorns. The wildcatÅfs yellow robes and the driver and 
the mushroom wagon all disappeared, and Ichiro was standing in front of his home 
holding his box of acorns.

The wildcat never again sent him a postcard. From time to time Ichiro wondered 
if he should have told the wildcat that he could command him to report to court.
