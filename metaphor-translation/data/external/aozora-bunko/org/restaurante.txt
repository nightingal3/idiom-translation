The Restaurant of Many Orders [Miyazawa Kenji] 
Once there were two young gentlemen deep in the mountains, among the dry leaves. 
They were dressed just like British soldiers and carried shiny guns. With them 
were two dogs that looked like polar bears. One of them said something like 
this:

ÅgWhatÅfs wrong with these mountains? We havenÅft seen a single bird nor beast! I 
wish something would show up so that I could shoot it. Bang! Baang!Åh
ÅgWouldnÅft it be nice to put a couple of bullets into the yellow belly of a deer 
about now! To watch it spin about a couple of times before it fell down dead!Åh

They were deep in the mountains. So deep, in fact, that even their hunter guide 
had gotten lost and wandered off. So deep, in fact, that even those dogs that 
looked like polar bears both got dizzy, and howled, and foamed at the mouth, and 
dropped dead.

ÅgWell there goes 2,400 yen!Åh said one of the men, peeling back his dogÅfs eyelid.
ÅgWell mine was 2,800 yen!Åh said the other man, his head lowered in regret.

The first gentleman went pale, and he carefully watched the other gentlemanÅfs 
expression as he said, ÅgI think we should head back.Åh
ÅgI think we should head back, too. The weather has gotten cold, and IÅfve gotten 
hungry.Åh
ÅgWell then letÅfs call it quits. On the way back, we can stop by that inn we 
stayed at yesterday and buy some game birds.Åh
ÅgThey had rabbit, too, didnÅft they? ItÅfll be just as if we hunted them 
ourselves. Well, letÅfs get going, then.Åh

But wouldnÅft you know, they had no idea which direction would get them back. The 
wind howled, the grass rustled, the leaves whispered, the trees creaked.

ÅgIÅfm so hungry! IÅfve had a pain in my side since a while back.Åh
ÅgMe, too. I hope we donÅft have to walk much further.Åh
ÅgI hope so, too. Oh, what shall we do? I really want something to eat!Åh
ÅgI really want something to eat, too!Åh

The two gentlemen carried on like that as they walked through the rustling 
grass.
Glancing behind, one of them saw an impressive Western-style house. At its 
entrance was a sign:


RESTAURANT
WILDCAT HOUSE


ÅgThis is perfect! ThereÅfs a place to eat right here! LetÅfs go in!Åh
ÅgWell now, I wonder what a restaurant is doing in a place like this? But I guess 
they serve food here...Åh
ÅgOf course they do! ThatÅfs what the sign says!Åh
ÅgWell then, letÅfs go in. IÅfm so hungry I could faint.Åh

The two of them stood at the entranceway. It was quite impressive, made of white 
porcelain bricks. There was also a glass door with gold writing that said:

All are welcome. Please come in for a free meal.

The two hunters were overjoyed, and said:
ÅgWell do you see that? What a wonderful place the world is. We had a bad time 
earlier today, but now look how lucky we are! Not only did we find a restaurant, 
but one with free food!Åh
ÅgThatÅfs right! The sign says that theyÅfll make us a free meal!Åh

They pushed open the door and went inside, entering a hallway. On the other side 
of the glass door was written:

We especially welcome our fat and young customers.

The two were thrilled to be especially welcomed.

ÅgHey! WeÅfre doubly welcome!Åh
ÅgThatÅfs right! WeÅfre both fat and young!Åh

Marching down the hallway, they next came to a door painted blue.

ÅgWhat an odd house. I wonder why it has so many doors?Åh
ÅgThis is the Russian style. All houses in cold places or in the mountains are 
built like this.Åh

As they began to open the door, they noticed something written in yellow above 
them:

This is a restaurant with many orders. Please be patient.

ÅgTheyÅfre that busy, all the way up here in the mountains?Åh
ÅgWell, sure. Even down in Tokyo, none of the big restaurants are on the main 
streets!Åh

As they were talking they opened the door. On the other side was written:

We really have many orders. Please be patient with each one.

One of the gentlemen grimaced, ÅgWell now, what do you think that means?Åh
ÅgWell, IÅfm sure it means that they have a lot of orders, and each one takes a 
lot of time to prepare, so please be patient.Åh
ÅgIÅfm sure thatÅfs it. I hope we get to the dining room soon.Åh
ÅgYes, IÅfd like a seat at a table.Åh

But wouldnÅft you know, instead they came upon another door. Next to it was a 
mirror, and below that a brush with a long handle. On the door, written in red, 
was:

Please fix your hair, and remove the mud from your boots.

ÅgWell thatÅfs reasonable. Before we came in I didnÅft think this would be such a 
nice place, being up here in the mountains.Åh
ÅgTheyÅfre quite strict about manners. They must get many important guests.Åh

So the two of them straightened up their hair, and brushed the mud from their 
boots.

Then, an amazing thing. Just as they replaced the brush to its shelf, it faded 
away and a wind whooshed into the room. The two were startled, and huddling 
close to each other threw open the door and hurried through to the next room. 
Both of them thought that if they didnÅft soon raise their spirits with something 
hot to eat, then something terrible would happen.

They again found something strange written on the other side of the door:

Please leave your guns and ammunition here.

Just next to the message was a black table.

ÅgWell, of course. We donÅft need guns to eat.Åh
ÅgThey must really have some important guests here.Åh

The two removed their guns and their ammunition belts and placed them on the 
table.

Next there was a black door.

Please remove your hats and overcoats and shoes.

ÅgWhat do you think?Åh
ÅgI guess we have to. There sure must be important guests in here.Åh

The two hung their hats and overcoats on a peg and removed their shoes, and 
flapped through the door. On the other side, it said:

Please leave here any tie pins, cuff links, eyeglasses, wallets, or other metal 
objects. Especially sharp ones.

Next to the door was an impressive safe, painted black and with its door open. 
There was even a key.

ÅgHmmm, IÅfll bet they somehow use electricity to cook here. That would make metal 
objects dangerous. ThatÅfs why they say that pointed things in particular should 
be left here.Åh
ÅgYes, thatÅfs surely it. So I guess weÅfll have to come back here to pay the 
bill.Åh
ÅgYes, IÅfm sure we will.Åh
ÅgYes, that sounds right.Åh

The two removed their glasses and their cuff links, put them in the safe, and 
locked it securely.
A little further down they came to another door, this one with a glass jar in 
front of it. On the door was written:

Please use the cream in the jar on your face, hands, and feet.

ÅgNow why would we need to use this cream?Åh
ÅgWell, itÅfs so cold outside, right? If we go from that cold to a warm room, our 
skin could crack and split. The cream is to prevent that. There must really be 
some important people in there. We may end up dining with royalty!Åh

The two put the cream on their faces and on their hands, and then took off their 
socks and put the cream on their feet. When they were done there was a little 
cream left. They each pretended to apply it to their face, but actually ate it. 
They then hurriedly opened the door, on the other side of which was written:

Are you sure you applied the cream everywhere? Even your ears?

Below that was another small jar.

ÅgWell indeed, I did forget to put it on my ears. I came close to making them 
crack and split. The owners here certainly are prepared for everything.Åh
ÅgYes, theyÅfve taken care of every detail. But I just want to get something to 
eat. I wonder how long these hallways will last?Åh

They soon came to the next door, which said:

The meal is almost prepared. Less than fifteen minutes now. Please splash the 
cologne in this bottle on your heads.

In front of the door was a shining golden perfume bottle. They splashed its 
contents onto their heads. Oddly, it smelled strongly of vinegar.

ÅgThis cologne smells a lot like vinegar. IsnÅft that strange?Åh
ÅgIt must be some mistake. Perhaps whoever put it here had a cold, and put the 
wrong liquid in the bottle.Åh

They opened the door and went inside. On the other side of the door was written:

WeÅfre sorry that you had to follow so many orders. Rest assured that this is the 
last one. Please rub plenty of this salt onto your bodies. 

Of course right there was a magnificent blue porcelain saltbox. This time the 
two gulped, and turned their cream-covered faces towards each other.

ÅgSomething is wrong here.Åh
ÅgI think that something is wrong here, too.Åh
ÅgThe Åemany ordersÅf... They were orders for us!Åh
One said, ÅgIÅfm starting to think that at this restaurant, they donÅft make meals 
for the people that come, they make the people that come into meals. Th... th... 
th... that would mean that w... w... w... we...Åh His teeth started chattering 
and his body started shivering and he couldnÅft speak any further.
The other said, ÅgYou mean... w... we... waaah!Åh He started shaking and he 
couldnÅft speak any further.
ÅgR... run!Åh said one of the gentlemen, pushing on the door behind them. But 
donÅft you know, the door wouldnÅft budge.

Further in was another door. It had two large keyholes, and a silver knife and 
fork carved into it. Written on it was:

Thank you for coming this far. You both look perfect. Now, please come in...

They could see two blue eyes peering in through the keyholes.

ÅgOooh!Åh Shivering, shivering.
ÅgNooo!Åh Shivering, shivering.

The two of them started to cry. From beyond the door, they could hear a 
whispered conversation:
ÅgSee? TheyÅfve figured it out. They wonÅft rub the salt into their bodies.Åh
ÅgWell of course not. Look at everything the boss wrote! ÅeRest assured that this 
is the last oneÅf... I mean, really now.Åh
ÅgAh, who cares? He wonÅft even leave us a bone to gnaw on.Åh
ÅgWell thatÅfs true. But even so, if they donÅft come through here, weÅfre the ones 
who have to do something about it.Åh
ÅgLetÅfs try calling them. Excuse me! Dear customers, could you please come this 
way? The plates are all washed, and the cabbage is salted and prepared. All we 
have left to do is arrange you and the cabbage on a white plate. Please come 
quickly!Åh
ÅgCome on, now, come on! Or perhaps you donÅft like salads? If you prefer, we 
could start a fire and have fried food instead. Regardless, please come 
quickly!Åh

The two were so distressed that their faces crumpled up like discarded paper, 
and seeing each otherÅfs distorted faces made them shiver all the more and start 
crying out loud. They heard a laughing voice shout from inside.

ÅgCome on in, come on in! If you cry like that youÅfll wash the cream off of your 
faces! Come on in! Yes sir, theyÅfre all ready. WeÅfll bring them in right away. 
Come on in, gentlemen!Åh
ÅgPlease come in! Our boss has his napkin around his neck, and is holding his 
knife and is licking his chops, waiting for you.Åh

The two cried and cried and cried and cried and cried.

Then, suddenly, from behind them,ÅgBow! Wow! Grrrr!Åh It was the two dogs like 
polar bears, breaking down the door and leaping into the room. The eyes 
immediately disappeared from the keyholes, and the dogs growled, running in 
circles about the room. Then, with a final bark, they pounced on the next door. 
The door crashed open, and the dogs jumped through as if sucked in.
Beyond the door was a pitch black darkness, and they heard a howling and 
screeching and a shuffling. Then the room faded away like smoke, and the two 
were left shivering in the cold in the middle of the tall grass.

Looking about they saw their coats and shoes and purses and tiepins hanging on 
branches and scattered about among the roots. The wind howled, the grass 
rustled, the leaves whispered, the trees creaked.

The dogs came back, howling. From behind, they heard, ÅgSirs! Sirs!Åh It was their 
guide in a straw hat, rustling his way towards them through the grass. The two 
were quite relieved. They ate some rice cakes that their guide had brought them, 
and returned to Tokyo, stopping only to buy some game birds.

But when they got back even taking a hot bath didnÅft repair their faces, 
crumpled up like discarded paper.

  "The Restaurant of Many Orders" was written in 1921 or 1922, and was published 
  (in 1924) in a collection of Miyazawa's fables of the same name. This book and 
  his book of poetry "Spring and Chaos" ÅiètÇ∆èCóÖÅj were the only two books of his 
  published when he was still alive.

  Today, this story is read by all Japanese students in elementary school, and 
  is one of Miyazawa's most famous. When I mentioned it to my wife, she had 
  forgotten the details (she thought that the hunters were eaten in the end), 
  but remembered being scared by the story when she first read it.

  A bit of analysis from what I've read about this story...

  The theme is of course "man vs. nature". The hunters represent man divorced 
  from (and exploiting) nature, foolish and self-deluding. The white (pure) dogs 
  represent nature. When the dogs die, the hunters look at this only in terms of 
  financial loss, and so their adventure is a kind of punishment.

  The white dogs can return to life because this is a common occurance in 
  nature-- life springing from death. They rescue the hunters who treated them 
  so poorly because nature has not only a malevolent (wildcat) side but also a 
  benevolent (dog) side, with natural occurances having little to do with the 
  past actions of man.

  There is some information about Miyazawa on Wikipedia.
