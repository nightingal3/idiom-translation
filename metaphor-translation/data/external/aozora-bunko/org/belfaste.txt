John Tyndall, Address Delivered Before the British Association Assembled at 
Belfast, With Additions. London: Longmans, Green, and Co., 1874.
The address before the annual meeting of the British Association for the 
Advancement of Science was an occasion to state the aims and concerns of the 
premiere body of elite men of Victorian science. It was consequently one of the 
most prestigious places from which to pronounce on what men of science should be 
doing. John Tyndall famously used his address in 1874 to argue for the superior 
authority of science over religious or non-rationalist explanations. By the time 
of this address the Association had largely been taken over by the young guard, 
men like T.H. Huxley and Tyndall. Nevertheless, Tyndall's bold statement for 
rationalism and natural law was made in Belfast, a stronghold of religious 
belief then as now and so it was taken as an aggressive attack on religion. The 
address was popularly believed to advocate materialism as the true philosophy of 
science. It remains a powerful call for rationalism, consistency, and 
scepticism.

Address Delivered Before the British Association Assembled at Belfast, With 
Additions
[page 1]
An impulse inherent in primeval man turned his thoughts and questionings betimes 
towards the sources of natural phenomena. The same impulse, inherited and 
intensified, is the spur of scientific action to-day. Determined by it, by a 
process of abstraction from experience we form physical theories which lie 
beyond the pale of experience, but which satisfy the desire of the mind to see 
every natural occurrence resting upon a cause. In forming their notions of the 
origin of things, our earliest historic (and doubtless, we might add, our 
prehistoric) ancestors pursued, as far as their intelligence permitted, the same 
course. They also fell back upon experience, but with this differenceóthat the 
particular experiences which furnished the weft and woof of their theories were 
drawn, not from the study of nature, but from what lay much closer to them, the 
observation of men. Their theories accordingly took an anthropomorphic form. To 
supersensual beings, which, 'however potent and invisible, were nothing but a 
species of human creatures, perhaps raised from among mankind, and retaining all 
human passions and appetites,' 1 were handed over the rule and governance of 
natural phenomena. Tested by observation and reflection, these early notions 
failed in the long run to satisfy the more penetrating intel-
1. Hume, Natural History of Religion.
[page 2]
lects of our race. Far in the depths of history we find men of exceptional power 
differentiating themselves from the crowd, rejecting these anthropomorphic 
notions, and seeking to connect natural phenomena with their physical 
principles. But long prior to these purer efforts of the understanding the 
merchant had been abroad, and rendered the philosopher possible; commerce had 
been developed, wealth amassed, leisure for travel and speculation secured, 
while races educated under different conditions, and therefore differently 
informed and endowed, had been stimulated and sharpened by mutual contact. In 
those regions where the commercial aristocracy of ancient Greece mingled with 
its eastern neighbours the sciences were born, being nurtured and developed by 
free-thinking and courageous men. The state of things to be displaced may be 
gathered from a passage of Euripides quoted by Hume. 'There is nothing in the 
world; no glory, no prosperity. The gods toss all into confusion; mix everything 
with its reverse, that all of us, from our ignorance and uncertainty may pay 
them the more worship and reverence.' Now, as science demands the radical 
extirpation of caprice and the absolute reliance upon law in nature, there grew 
with the growth of scientific notions a desire and determination to sweep from 
the field of theory this mob of gods and demons, and to place natural phenomena 
on a basis more congruent with themselves.
The problem which had been previously approached from above was now attacked 
from below; theoretic effort passed from the super- to the sub-sensible. It was 
felt that to construct the universe in idea it was necessary to have some notion 
of its constituent partsóof what Lucretius subsequently called the 'First 
Beginnings.' Abstracting again from experience, the leaders of scientific 
speculation reached at length the pregnant doctrine of atoms and
[page 3]
molecules, the latest developments of which were set forth with such power and 
clearness at the last meeting of the British Association. Thought, no doubt, had 
long hovered about this doctrine before it attained the precision and 
completeness which it assumed in the mind of Democritus,2 a philosopher who may 
well for a moment arrest our attention. 'Few great men,' says Lange, a 
non-materialist, in his excellent 'History of Materialism,' to the spirit and to 
the letter of which I am equally indebted, 'have been so despitefully used by 
history as Democritus. In the distorted images sent down to us through 
unscientific traditions there remains of him almost nothing but the name of "the 
laughing philosopher, " while figures of immeasurably smaller significance 
spread themselves out at full length before us.' Lange speaks of Bacon's high 
appreciation of Democritusófor ample illustrations of which I am indebted to my 
excellent friend Mr. Spedding, the learned editor and biographer of Bacon. It is 
evident, indeed, that Bacon considered Democritus to be a man of weightier metal 
than either Plato or Aristotle, though their philosophy 'was noised and 
celebrated in the schools, amid the din and pomp of professors.' It was not 
they, but Genseric and Attila and the barbarians, who destroyed the atomic 
philosophy. 'For at a time when all human learning had suffered shipwreck these 
planks of Aristotelian and Platonic philosophy, as being of a lighter and more 
inflated substance, were preserved and came down to us, while things more solid 
sank and almost passed into oblivion.'
The son of a wealthy farmer, Democritus devoted the whole of his inherited 
fortune to the culture of his mind. He travelled everywhere; visited Athens when 
Socrates and Plato were there, but quitted the city without making himself 
known.
2. Born 460 b. c.
[page 4] 
Indeed, the dialectic strife in which Socrates so much delighted had no charms 
for Democritus, who held that 'the man who readily contradicts and uses many 
words is unfit to learn anything truly right.' He is said to have discovered and 
educated Protagoras the sophist, being struck as much by the manner in which he, 
being a hewer of wood, tied up his faggots as by the sagacity of his 
conversation. Democritus returned poor from his travels, was supported by his 
brother, and at length wrote his great work entitled 'Diakosmos,' which he read 
publicly before the people of his native town. He was honoured by his countrymen 
in various ways, and died serenely at a great age.
The principles enunciated by Democritus reveal his uncompromising antagonism to 
those who deduced the phenomena of nature from the caprices of the gods. They 
are briefly these: ÅE/p> 
1. From nothing comes nothing. Nothing that exists can be destroyed. All changes 
are due to the combination and separation of molecules.
2. Nothing happens by chance. Every occurrence has its cause from which it 
follows by necessity.
3. The only existing things are the atoms and empty space; all else is mere 
opinion. 
4. The atoms are infinite in number and infinitely various in form; they strike 
together, and the lateral motions and whirlings which thus arise are the 
beginnings of worlds. 
5. The varieties of all things depend upon the varieties of their atoms, in 
number, size, and aggregation. 
6. The soul consists of fine, smooth, round atoms, like those of fire. These are 
the most mobile of all. They interpenetrate the whole body, and in their motions 
the phenomena of life arise. 
The first five propositions are a fair general statement of the atomic 
philosophy, as now held. As regards the sixth, Democritus made his fine smooth 
atoms do duty for the nervous 
[page 5]
system, whose functions were then unknown. The atoms of Democritus are 
individually without sensation; they combine in obedience to mechanical laws; 
and not only organic forms, but the phenomena of sensation and thought are the 
result of their combination.
That great enigma, 'the exquisite adaptation of one part of an organism to 
another part, and to the conditions of life,' more especially the construction 
of the human body, Democritus made no attempt to solve. Empedocles, a man of 
more fiery and poetic nature, introduced the notion of love and hate among the 
atoms to account for, their combination and separation. Noticing this gap in the 
doctrine of Democritus, he struck in with the penetrating thought, linked, 
however, with some wild speculation, that it lay in the very nature of those 
combinations which were suited to their ends (in other words, in harmony with 
their environment) to maintain themselves, while unfit combinations, having no 
proper habitat, must rapidly disappear. Thus more than 2,000 years ago the 
doctrine of the 'survival of the fittest,' which in our day, not on the basis of 
vague conjecture, but of positive knowledge, has been raised to such 
extraordinary significance, had received at all events partial enunciation. 3
Epicurus,4 said to be the son of a poor schoolmaster at Samos, is the next 
dominant figure in the history of the atomic philosophy. He mastered the 
writings of Democritus, heard lectures in Athens, went back to Samos, and 
subsequently wandered through various countries. He finally returned to Athens, 
where he bought a garden, and surrounded himself by pupils, in the midst of whom 
he lived a pure and serene life, and died a peaceful death. Democritus looked to 
the soul as the ennobling part of 
3. Lange, 2nd edit., p. 23.
4. Born 342 b. c. 
[page 6]
man; even beauty without understanding partook of animalism. Epicurus also rated 
the spirit above the body; the pleasure of the body was that of the moment, 
while the spirit could draw upon the future and the past. His philosophy was 
almost identical with that of Democritus; be he never quoted either friend or 
foe. One main object of Epicurus was to free the world from superstition and the 
fear of death. Death he treated with indifference. It merely robs us of 
sensation. As long as we are, death is not; and when death is, we are not. Life 
has no more evil for him who has made up his mind that it is no evil not to 
live. He adored the gods, but not in the ordinary fashion. The idea of divine 
power, properly purified, he thought an elevating one. Still he taught, 'Not he 
is godless who rejects the gods of the crowd, but rather he who accepts them.' 
The gods were to him eternal and immortal beings, whose blessedness excluded 
every thought of care or occupation of any kind. Nature pursues her course in 
accordance with everlasting laws, the gods never interfering. They haunt
The lucid interspace of world and world
Where never creeps a cloud or moves a wind,
Nor ever falls the least white star of snow,
Nor ever lowest roll of thunder moans,
Nor sound of human sorrow mounts to mar
Their sacred everlasting calm.5
Lange considers the relation of Epicurus to the gods subjective; the indication 
probably of an ethical requirement of his own nature. We cannot read history 
with open eyes, or study human nature to its depths, and fail to discern such a 
requirement. Man never has been, and he never will be, satisfied with the 
operations and products of the Understanding alone; hence physical science 
cannot 
5. Tennyson's Lucretius. 
[page 7]
cover all the demands of his nature. But the history of the efforts made to 
satisfy these demands might be broadly described as a history of errorsóthe 
error, in great part, consisting in ascribing fixity to that which is fluent, 
which varies as we vary, being gross when we are gross, and becoming, as our 
capacities widen, more abstract and sublime. On one great point the mind of 
Epicurus was at peace. He neither sought nor expected, here or hereafter, any 
personal profit from his relation to the gods. And it is assuredly a fact that 
loftiness and serenity of thought may be promoted by conceptions which involve 
no idea of profit of this kind. 'Did I not believe,' said a great man to me 
once, 'that an Intelligence is at the heart of things, my life on earth would be 
intolerable.' The utterer of these words is not, in my opinion, rendered less 
noble but more noble by the fact that it was the need of ethical harmony here, 
and not the thought of personal profit hereafter, that prompted his observation.
There are persons, not belonging to the highest intellectual zone, nor yet to 
the lowest, to whom perfect clearness of exposition suggests want of depth. They 
find comfort and edification in an abstract and learned phraseology. To some 
such people Epicurus, who spared no pains to rid his style of every trace of 
haze and turbidity, appeared, on this very account, superficial. He had, 
however, a disciple who thought it no unworthy occupation to spend his days and 
nights in the effort to reach the clearness of his master, and to whom the Greek 
philosopher is mainly indebted for the extension and perpetuation of his fame. A 
century and a half after the death of Epicurus, Lucretius6 wrote his great poem, 
 'On the Nature of Things,' in which he, a Roman, 
6. Born 99 b. c.
[page 8]
developed with extraordinary ardour the philosophy of his Greek predecessor. He 
wishes to win over his friend Memnius to the school of Epicurus; and although he 
has no rewards in a future life to offer, although his object appears to be a 
purely negative one, he addresses his friend with the heat of an apostle. His 
object, like that of his great forerunner, is the destruction of superstition; 
and considering that men trembled before every natural event as a direct 
monition from the gods, and that everlasting torture was also in prospect, the 
freedom aimed at by Lucretius might perhaps be deemed a positive good. 'This 
terror,' he says, 'and darkness of mind must be dispelled, not by the rays of 
the sun and glittering shafts of day, but by the aspect and the law of nature.' 
He refutes the notion that anything can come out of nothing, or that that which 
is once begotten can be recalled to nothing. The first beginnings, the atoms, 
are indestructible, and into them all things can be resolved at last. Bodies are 
partly atoms, and partly combinations of atoms; but the atoms nothing can 
quench. They are strong in solid singleness, and by their denser combination all 
things can be closely packed and exhibit enduring strength. He denies that 
matter is infinitely divisible. We come at length to the atoms, without which, 
as an imperishable substratum, all order in the generation and development of 
things would be destroyed.
The mechanical shock of the atoms being in his view the all-sufficient cause of 
things, he combats the notion that the constitution of nature has been in any 
way determined by intelligent design. The inter-action of the atoms throughout 
infinite time rendered all manner of combinations possible. Of these the fit 
ones persisted, while the unfit ones disappeared. Not after sage deliberation 
did the atoms station themselves in their right places, nor 
[page 9]
did they bargain what motions they should assume. From all eternity they have 
been driven together, and after trying motions and unions of every kind, they 
fell at length into the arrangements out of which this system of things has been 
formed. 'If you will apprehend and keep in mind these things, nature, free at 
once, and rid of her haughty lords, is seen to do all things spontaneously of 
herself, without the meddling of the gods.'7
To meet the objection that his atoms cannot be seen, Lucretius describes a 
violent storm, and shows that the invisible particles of air act in the same way 
as the visible particles of water. We perceive, moreover, the different smells 
of things, yet never see them coming to our nostrils. Again, clothes hung up on 
a shore which waves break upon become moist, and then get dry if spread out in 
the sun, though no eye can see either the approach or the escape of the water 
particles. A ring, worn long on the finger, becomes thinner; a water-drop 
hollows out a stone; the ploughshare is rubbed away in the field; the street 
pavement is worn by the feet; but the particles that disappear at any moment we 
cannot see. Nature acts through invisible particles. That Lucretius had a strong 
scientific imagination the foregoing references prove. A fine illustration of 
his power in this respect is his explanation of the apparent rest of bodies 
whose atoms are in motion. He employs the image of a flock of sheep with 
skipping lambs, which, seen from a distance, presents simply a white patch upon 
the green hill, the jumping of the individual lambs being quite invisible.
7. Monro's translation. In his criticism of this work, Contemporary Review, 
1867, Dr. Hayman does not appear to be aware of the really sound and subtile 
observations on which the reasoning of Lucretius, though erroneous, sometimes 
rests.
[page 10]
His vaguely-grand conception of the atoms falling eternally through space 
suggested the nebular hypothesis to Kant, its first propounder. Far beyond the 
limits of our visible world are to be found atoms innumerable, which have never 
been united to form bodies, or which, if once united, have been again dispersed, 
falling silently through immeasurable intervals of time and space. As everywhere 
throughout the All the same conditions are repeated, so must the phenomena be 
repeated also. Above us, below us, beside us, therefore, are worlds without end; 
and this, when considered, must dissipate every thought of a deflection of the 
universe by the gods. The worlds come and go, attracting new atoms out of 
limitless space, or dispersing their own particles. The reputed death of 
Lucretius, which forms the basis of Mr. Tennyson's noble poem, is in strict 
accordance with his philosophy, which was severe and pure.
During the centuries lying between the first of these three philosophers and the 
last, the human intellect was active in other fields than theirs. The sophists 
had run through their career. At Athens had appeared Socrates, Plato, and 
Aristotle, who ruined the sophists, and whose yoke remains to some extent 
unbroken to the present hour. Within this period also the School of Alexandria 
was founded, Euclid wrote his 'Elements, ' and made some advance in optics. 
Archimedes had propounded the theory of the lever and the principles of 
hydrostatics. Pythagoras had made his experiments on the harmonic intervals, 
while astronomy was immensely enriched by the discoveries of Hipparchus, who was 
followed by the historically more celebrated Ptolemy. Anatomy had been made the 
basis of Scientific medicine; and it is said by 
[page 11]
Draper8 that vivisection then began. In fact, the science of ancient Greece had 
already cleared the world of the fantastic images of divinities operating 
capriciously through natural phenomena. It had shaken itself free from that 
fruitless scrutiny 'by the internal light of the mind alone,' which had vainly 
sought to transcend experience and reach a knowledge of ultimate causes. Instead 
of accidental observation, it had introduced observation with a purpose; 
instruments were employed to aid the senses; and scientific method was rendered 
in a great measure complete by the union of Induction and Experiment.
What, then, stopped its victorious advance? Why was the scientific intellect 
compelled, like an exhausted soil, to lie fallow for nearly two millenniums 
before it could regather the elements necessary to its fertility and strength? 
Bacon has already let us know one cause; Whewell ascribes this stationary period 
to four causesóobscurity of thought, servility, intolerance of disposition, 
enthusiasm of temperóand he gives striking examples of each. 9 But these 
characteristics must have had their antecedants in the circumstances of the 
time. Rome and the other cities of the Empire had fallen into moral 
putrefaction. Christianity had appeared, offering the gospel to the poor, and, 
by moderation if not asceticism of life, practically protesting against the 
profligacy of the age. The sufferings of the early Christians, and the 
extraordinary exaltation of mind which enabled them to triumph over the 
diabolical tortures to which they were subjected, 10 must have left traces not 
easily effaced. They scorned the earth, in view of that 'building of God, that

10. Depicted with terrible vividness in Renan's Antichrist. 
[page 12]
house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.' The Scriptures which 
ministered to their spiritual needs were also the measure of their Science. 
When, for example, the celebrated question of antipodes came to be discussed, 
the Bible was with many the ultimate court of appeal. Augustine, who flourished 
a.d. 400, would not deny the rotundity of the earth; but he would deny the 
possible existence of inhabitants at the other side, 'because no such race is 
recorded in Scripture among the descendants of Adam.' Archbishop Boniface was 
shocked at the assumption of a 'world of human beings out of the reach of the 
means of salvation.' Thus reined in, Science was not likely to make much 
progress. Later on the political and theological strife between the Church and 
civil governments, so powerfully depicted by Draper, must have done much to 
stifle investigation.
Whewell makes many wise and brave remarks regarding the spirit of the Middle 
Ages. It was a menial spirit. The seekers after natural knowledge had forsaken 
that fountain of living waters, the direct appeal to nature by observation and 
experiment, and had given themselves up to the remanipulation of the notions of 
their predecessors. It was a time when thought had become abject, and when the 
acceptance of mere authority led, as it always does in science, to intellectual 
death. Natural events, instead of being traced to physical, were referred to 
moral causes; while an exercise of the phantasy, almost as degrading as the 
spiritualism of the present day, took the place of scientific speculation. Then 
came the mysticism of the Middle Ages, Magic, Alchemy, the Neo-platonic 
philosophy, with its visionary though sublime abstractions, which caused men to 
look with shame upon their own bodies as hindrances to the absorption of the 
creature in the blessedness of the Creator. Finally came 
[page 13]
the Scholastic philosophy, a fusion, according to Lange, of the least-mature 
notions of Aristotle with the Christianity of the West. Intellectual immobility 
was the result. As a traveller without a compass in a fog may wander long, 
imagining he is making way, and find himself after hours of toil at his starting 
point, so the schoolmen, having 'tied and untied the same knots and formed and 
dissipated the same clouds,' found themselves at the end of centuries in their 
old position. With regard to the influence wielded by Aristotle in the Middle 
Ages, and which, though to a less extent, he still wields, I would ask 
permission to make one remark. When the human mind has achieved greatness and 
given evidence of extraordinary power in any domain, there is a tendency to 
credit it with similar power in all other domains. Thus theologians have found 
comfort and assurance in the thought that Newton dealt with the question of 
revelation, forgetful of the fact that the very devotion of his powers, through 
all the best years of his life, to a totally different class of ideas, not to 
speak of any natural disqualification, tended to render him less instead of more 
competent to deal with theological and historic questions. Goethe, starting from 
his established greatness as a poet, and indeed from his positive discoveries in 
Natural History, produced a profound impression among the painters of Germany 
when he published his 'Farbenlehre' in which he endeavoured to overthrow 
Newton's theory of colours. This theory seemed so obviously absurd that he 
considered the author a charlatan, and attacked him with a corresponding 
vehemence of language. In the domain of Natural History Goethe had made fully 
considerable discoveries; and we have high authority for assuming that, had he 
devoted himself wholly to that side of science, he might have reached in 
[page 14]
it an eminence comparable with that which he attained as a poet. In sharpness of 
observation, in the detection of analogies, however apparently remote, in the 
classification and organization of facts according to the analogies discerned, 
Goethe possessed extraordinary powers. These elements of scientific inquiry fall 
in with the discipline of the poet. But, on the other hand, a mind thus richly 
endowed in the direction of natural history may be almost shorn of endowment as 
regards the more strictly called physical and mechanical sciences. Goethe was in 
this condition. He could not formulate distinct mechanical conceptions; he could 
not see the force of mechanical reasoning; and in regions where such reasoning 
reigns supreme he became a mere ignis fatuus to those who followed him.
I have sometimes permitted myself to compare Aristotle with Goethe, to credit 
the Stagirite with an almost superhuman power of amassing and systematizing 
facts, but to consider him fatally defective on that side of the mind in respect 
to which incompleteness has been just ascribed to Goethe. Whewell refers the 
errors of Aristotle, not to a neglect of facts, but to 'a neglect of the idea 
appropriate to the facts; the idea of Mechanical cause, which is Force, and the 
substitution of vague or inapplicable notions, involving only relations of space 
or emotions of wonder.' This is doubtless true; but the word 'neglect' implies 
mere intellectual misdirection, whereas in Aristotle, as in Goethe, it was not, 
I believe, misdirection, but sheer natural incapacity which lay at the root of 
his mistakes. As a physicist, Aristotle displayed what we should consider some 
of the worst attributes of a modern physical investigatoróindistinctness of 
ideas, confusion of mind, and a confident use of language, which led to the 
delusive notion that he had really 
[page 15]
mastered his subject, while he had as yet failed to grasp even the elements of 
it. He put words in the place of things, subject in the place of object. He 
preached Induction without practising it, inverting the true order of inquiry by 
passing from the general to the particular, instead of from the particular to 
the general. He made of the universe a closed sphere, in the centre of which he 
fixed the earth, proving from general principles, to his own satisfaction and to 
that of the world for near 2,000 years, that no other universe was possible. His 
notions of motion were entirely unphysical. It was natural or unnatural, better 
or worse, calm or violentóno real mechanical conception regarding it lying at the 
bottom of his mind. He affirmed that a vacuum could not exist, and proved that 
if it did exist motion in it would be impossible. He determined a priori how 
many species of animals must exist, and shows on general principles why animals 
must have such and such parts. When an eminent contemporary philosopher, who is 
far removed from errors of this kind, remembers these abuses of the a priori 
method, he will be able to make allowance for the jealousy of physicists as to 
the acceptance of so-called a priori truths. Aristotle's errors of detail, as 
shown by Eucken and Lange, were grave and numerous. He affirmed that only in man 
we had the beating of the heart, that the left side of the body was colder than 
the right, that men have more teeth than women, and that there is an empty space 
at the back of every man's head.
There is one essential quality in physical conceptions which was entirely 
wanting in those of Aristotle and his followers. I wish it could be expressed by 
a word untainted by its associations; it signifies a capability of being placed 
as a coherent picture before the mind. The Germans express the act of picturing 
by the word vorstellen, and the 
[page 16]
picture they call a Vorstellung. We have no word in English which comes nearer 
to our requirements than Imagination, and, taken with its proper limitations, 
the word answers very well; but, as just intimated, it is tainted by its 
associations, and therefore objectionable to some minds. Compare, with reference 
to this capacity of mental presentation, the case of the Aristotelian who refers 
the ascent of water in a pump to Nature's abhorrence of a vacuum, with that of 
Pascal when he proposed to solve the question of atmospheric pressure by the 
ascent of the Puy de Dome. In the one case the terms of the explanation refuse 
to fall into place as a physical image; in the other the image is distinct, the 
fall and rise of the barometer being clearly figured as the balancing of two 
varying and opposing pressures.
During the drought of the Middle Ages in Christendom, the Arabian intellect, as 
forcibly shown by Draper, was active. With the intrusion of the Moors into 
Spain, he says, order, learning, and refinement took the place of their 
opposites. When smitten with disease, the Christian peasant resorted to a 
shrine, the Moorish one to an instructed physician. The Arabs encouraged 
translations from the Greek philosophers, but not from the Greek poets. They 
turned in disgust 'from the lewdness of our classical mythology, and denounced 
as an unpardonable blasphemy all connexion between the impure Olympian Jove and 
the Most High God.' Draper traces still further than Whewell the Arab elements 
in our scientific terms, and 
[page 17]
points out that the under garment of ladies retains to this hour its Arab name. 
He gives examples of what Arabian men of science accomplished, dwelling 
particularly on Alhazen, who was the first to correct the Platonic notion that 
rays of light are emitted by the eye. He discovered atmospheric refraction, and 
points out that we see the sun and the moon after they have set. He explains the 
enlargement of the sun and moon, and the shortening of the vertical diameters of 
both these bodies, when near the horizon. He is aware that the atmosphere 
decreases in density with increase of elevation, and actually fixes its height 
at 58 1/2 miles. In the Book of the Balance of Wisdom, he sets forth the 
connexion between the weight of the atmosphere and its increasing density. He 
shows that a body will weigh differently in a rare and dense atmosphere: he 
considers the force with which plunged bodies rise through heavier media. He 
understands the doctrine of the centre of gravity, and applies it to the 
investigation of balances and steelyards. He recognises gravity as a force, 
though he falls into the error of making it diminish simply as the distance 
increased, and of making it purely terrestrial. He knows the relation between 
the velocities, spaces, and times of falling bodies, and has distinct ideas of 
capillary attraction. He improved the hydrometer. The determination of the 
densities of bodies as given by Alhazen approach very closely to our own. 'I 
join' says Draper, in the pious prayer of Alhazen, 'that in the day of judgment 
the All-Merciful will take pity on the soul of Abur-Raih&acirc;n, because he was the 
first of the race of men to construct a table of specific gravities.' If all 
this be historic truth (and I have entire confidence in Dr. Draper), well may he 
'deplore the systematic manner in which the literature of Europe has contrived 
to put out of sight our scientific obligations to the Mahommedans.'11
The strain upon the mind during the stationary period towards ultra-terrestrial 
things, to the neglect of problems close at hand, was sure to provoke reaction. 
But the reaction was gradual; for the ground was dangerous, a 
11. Intellectual Development of Europe, p. 359.
[page 18]
power being at hand competent to crush the critic who went too far. To elude 
this power and still allow opportunity for the expression of opinion, the 
doctrine of 'two-fold truth' was invented, according to which an opinion might 
be held 'theologically' and the opposite opinion 'philosophically.'12 Thus in 
the thirteenth century the creation of the world in six days, and the 
unchangeableness of the individual soul which had been so distinctly affirmed by 
St. Thomas Aquinas, were both denied philosophically, but admitted to be true as 
articles of the Catholic faith. When Protagoras uttered the maxim which brought 
upon him so much vituperation, that 'opposite assertions are equally true,' he 
simply meant that human beings differed so much from each other that what was 
subjectively true to the one might be subjectively untrue to the other. The 
great Sophist never meant to play fast and loose with the truth by saying that 
one of two opposite assertions made by the same individual could possibly escape 
being a lie. It was not 'sophistry,' but the dread of theologic vengeance that 
generated this double dealing with conviction; and it is astonishing to notice 
what lengths were possible to men who were adroit in the use of artifices of 
this kind.
Towards the close of the stationary period a word-weariness, if I may so express 
it, took more and more possession of men's minds. Christendom had become sick of 
the School philosophy and its verbal wastes, which led to no issue, but left the 
intellect in everlasting haze. Here and there was heard the voice of one 
impatiently crying in the wilderness, 'Not unto Aristotle, not unto subtle 
hypothesis, not unto church, Bible, or blind tradition, must we turn for a 
knowledge of the universe, but to the direct investigation of Nature by 
observation and

[page 19]
experiment.' In 1543 the epoch-making work of Copernicus on the paths of the 
heavenly bodies appeared. The total crash of Aristotle's closed universe with 
the earth at its centre followed as a consequence, and 'the earth moves!' became 
a kind of watchword among intellectual freemen. Copernicus was Canon of the 
Church of Frauenburg, in the diocese of Ermeland. For three-and-thirty years he 
had withdrawn himself from the world and devoted himself to the consolidation of 
his great scheme of the solar system. He made its blocks eternal; and even to 
those who feared it and desired its overthrow it was so obviously strong that 
they refrained for a time from meddling with it. In the last year of the life of 
Copernicus his book appeared: it is said that the old man received a copy of it 
a few days before his death, and then departed in peace.
The Italian philosopher Giordano Bruno was one of the earliest converts to the 
new astronomy. Taking Lucretius as his exemplar, he revived the notion of the 
infinity of worlds; and, combining with it the doctrine of Copernicus, reached 
the sublime generalization that the fixed stars are suns, scattered numberless 
through space and accompanied by satellites, which bear the same relation to 
them that our earth does to our sun, or our moon to our earth. This was an 
expansion of transcendent import; but Bruno came closer than this to our present 
line of thought. Struck with the problem of the generation and maintenance of 
organisms, and duly pondering it, he came to the conclusion that Nature in her 
productions does not imitate the technic of man. Her process is one of 
unravelling and unfolding. The infinity of forms under which matter appears were 
not imposed upon it by an external artificer; by its own intrinsic force and 
virtue it brings these forms forth. 
[page 20]
Matter is not the mere naked, empty capacity which philosophers have pictured 
her to be, but the universal mother who brings forth all things as the fruit of 
her own womb.
This outspoken man was originally a Dominican monk. He was accused of heresy and 
had to fly, seeking refuge in Geneva, Paris, England, and Germany. In 1592 he 
fell into the hands of the Inquisition at Venice. He was imprisoned for many 
years, tried, degraded, excommunicated, and handed over to the civil power, with 
the request that he should be treated gently and 'without the shedding of 
blood.' This meant that he was to be burnt; and burnt accordingly he was, on the 
16th of February, 1600. To escape a similar fate Galileo, thirty-three years 
afterwards, abjured, upon his knees, and with his hand upon the holy gospels, 
the heliocentric doctrine which he knew to be true. After Galileo came Kepler, 
who from his German home defied the power beyond the Alps. He traced out from 
pre-existing observations the laws of planetary motion. Materials were thus 
prepared for Newton, who bound those empirical laws together by the principle of 
gravitation.
In the seventeenth century Bacon and Descartes, the restorers of philosophy, 
appeared in succession. Differently educated and endowed, their philosophic 
tendencies were different. Bacon held fast to Induction, believing firmly in the 
existence of an external world, and making collected experiences the basis of 
all knowledge. The mathematical studies of Descartes gave him a bias towards 
Deduction; and his fundamental principle was much the same as that of 
Protagoras, who made the individual man the measure of all things. 'I think, 
therefore I am,' said Descartes. Only his own identity was sure to him; and the 
development of this system would have led to an idealism in 
[page 21]
which the outer world would be resolved into a mere phenomenon of consciousness. 
Gassendi, one of Descartes's contemporaries, of whom we shall hear more 
presently, quickly pointed out that the fact of personal existence would be 
proved as well by reference to any other act as to the act of thinking. I eat, 
therefore I am; or I love, therefore I am, would be quite as conclusive: 
Lichtenberg showed that the very thing to be proved was inevitably postulated in 
the first two words, 'I think;' and that no inference from the postulate could 
by any possibility be stronger than the postulate itself.
But Descartes deviated strangely from the idealism implied in his fundamental 
principle. He was the first to reduce, in a manner eminently capable of bearing 
the test of mental presentation, vital phenomena to purely mechanical 
principles. Through fear or love, Descartes was a good churchman; he accordingly 
rejects the notion of an atom, because it was absurd to suppose that God, if he 
so pleased, could not divide an atom; he puts in the place of the atoms small 
round particles and light splinters, out of which he builds the organism. He 
sketches with marvellous physical insight a machine, with water for its motive 
power, which shall illustrate vital actions. He has made clear to his mind that 
such a machine would be competent to carry on the processes of digestion, 
nutrition, growth, respiration, and the bearing of the heart. It would be 
competent to accept impressions from the external sense, to store them up in 
imagination and memory, to go through the internal movements of the appetites 
and passions, the external movement of limbs. He deduces these functions of his 
machine from the mere arrangement of its organs, as the movement of a clock or 
other automaton is deduced from its weights and wheels. 'As far as these 
functions are concerned,' he 
[page 22]
says, 'it is not necessary to conceive any other vegetative or sensitive soul, 
nor any other principle of motion or of life, than the blood and the spirits 
agitated by the fire which burns continually in the heart, and which is in no 
wise different from the fires which exist in inanimate bodies.' Had Descartes 
been acquainted with the steam-engine, he would have taken it, instead of a fall 
of water, as his motive power, and shown the perfect analogy which exists 
between the oxidation of the food in the body and that of the coal in the 
furnace. He would assuredly have anticipated Mayer in calling the blood which 
the heart diffuses 'the oil of the lamp of life;' deducing all animal motions 
from the combustion of this oil, as the motions of a steam-engine are deduced 
from the combustion of its coal. As the matter stands, however, and considering 
the circumstances of the time, the boldness, clearness, and precision with which 
he grasped the problem of vital dynamics constitute a marvellous illustration of 
intellectual power. 13
During the Middle Ages the doctrine of atoms had to all appearance vanished from 
discussion. In all probability it held its ground among sober-minded and 
thoughtful men, though neither the church nor the world was prepared to hear of 
it with tolerance. Once, in the year 1348, it received distinct expression. But 
retraction by compulsion immediately followed, and, thus discouraged, it 
slumbered till the seventeenth century, when it was revived by a contemporary 
and friend of Hobbes and Malmesbury, the orthodox Catholic provost of Digne, 
Gassendi. But before stating his relation to the Epicurean doctrine, it will be 
well to say a few words on the effect, 
13. See Huxley's admirable Essay on Descartes. Lay Sermons, pp. 364, 365.
[page 23]
as regards science, of the general introduction of monotheism among European 
nations.
'Were men,' says Hume, 'led into the apprehension of invisible intelligent power 
by contemplation of the works of Nature, they could never possibly entertain any 
conception but of one single being, who bestowed existence and order on this 
vast machine, and adjusted all its parts to one regular system.' Referring to 
the condition of the heathen, who sees a god behind every natural event, thus 
peopling the world with thousands of beings whose caprices are incalculable, 
Lange shows the impossibility of any compromise between such notions and those 
of science, which proceeds on the assumption of never-changing law and 
causality. 'But,' he continues, with characteristic penetration, 'when the great 
thought of one God, acting as a unit upon the universe, has been seized, the 
connexion of things in accordance with the law of cause and effect is not only 
thinkable, but it is a necessary consequence of the assumption. For when I see 
ten thousand wheels in motion, and know, or believe, that they are all driven by 
one, then I know that I have before me a mechanism the action of every part of 
which is determined by the plan of the whole. So much being assumed, it follows 
that I may investigate the structure of that machine, and the various motions of 
its parts. For the time being, therefore, this conception renders scientific 
action free.' In other words, were a capricious God at the circumference of 
every wheel and at the end of every lever, the action of the machine would be 
incalculable by the methods of science. But the action of all its parts being 
rigidly determined by their connexions and relations, and these being brought 
into play by a single self-acting driving wheel, then, though this last prime 
[page 24]
mover may elude me, I am still able to comprehend the machinery which it sets in 
motion. We have here a conception of the relation of Nature to its Author which 
seems perfectly acceptable to some minds, but perfectly intolerable to others. 
Newton and Boyle lived and worked happily under the influence of this 
conception; Goethe rejected it with vehemence, and the same repugnance to 
accepting it is manifest in Carlyle. 14
The analytic and synthetic tendencies of the human mind exhibit themselves 
throughout history, great writers ranging themselves sometimes on the one side, 
sometimes on the other. Men of warm feelings and minds open to the elevating 
impressions produced by Nature as a whole, whose satisfaction, therefore, is 
rather ethical than logical, lean to the synthetic side, while the analytic 
harmonizes best with the more precise and more mechanical bias which seeks the 
satisfaction of the understanding. Some form of pantheism was usually adopted by 
the one, while a detached Creator, working more or less after the manner of men, 
was often assumed by the other. Gassendi is hardly to be ranked with either. 
Having formally acknowledged God as the great first cause, he immediately 
dropped the idea, applied the known laws of mechanics to the atoms, deducing 
thence all vital phenomena. He defended Epicurus, and dwelt upon his purity, 
both of doctrine and of life. True he was a heathen, but so was Aristotle. He 
assailed superstition and religion, and rightly, because he did not know the 
true religion. He thought that the gods neither rewarded nor
14. Boyle's model of the universe was the Strasburg clock with an outside 
Artificer. Goethe, on the other hand, sang 'Ihm ziemt's die Welt im Innern zu 
bewegen, / Natur in sich, sich in Natur zu hegen. ' See also Carlyle, Past and 
Present, Chap. V.
[page 25]
punished, and adored them purely in consequence of their completeness; here we 
see, says Gassendi, the reverence of the child instead of the fear of the slave. 
The errors of Epicurus shall be corrected, the body of his truth retained; and 
then Gassendi proceeds, as any heathen might do, to build up the world, and all 
that therein is, of atoms and molecules. God, who created earth and water, 
plants and animals, produced in the first place a definite number of atoms, 
which constituted the seed of all things. Then began that series of combinations 
and decompositions which goes on at present, and which will continue in future. 
The principle of every change resides in matter. In artificial productions the 
moving principle is different from the material worked upon; but in Nature the 
agent works within, being the most active and mobile part of the material 
itself. Thus, this bold ecclesiastic, without incurring the censure of the 
church or the world, contrives to outstrip Mr. Darwin. The same cast of mind 
which caused him to detach the Creator from his universe led him also to detach 
the soul from the body, though to the body he ascribes an influence so large as 
to render the soul almost unnecessary. The aberrations of reason were in his 
view an affair of the material brain. Mental disease is brain disease; but then 
the immortal reason sits apart, and cannot be touched by the disease. The errors 
of madness are errors of the instrument, not of the performer.
It may be more than a mere result of education, connecting itself probably with 
the deeper mental structure of the two men, that the idea of Gassendi above 
enunciated is substantially the same as that expressed by Professor  Clerk 
Maxwell at the close of the very able lecture delivered by him at Bradford last 
year. According to both philosophers, the atoms, if I might understand aright, 
are
[page 26]
the prepared materials which, formed by the skill of the highest, produce by 
their subsequent inter-action all the phenomena of the material world. There 
seems to be this difference, however, between Gassendi and Maxwell. The one 
postulates, the other infers his first cause. In his 'manufactured articles,' as 
he calls the atoms, Professor Maxwell finds the basis of an induction which 
enables him to scale philosophic heights considered inaccessible by Kant, and to 
take the logical step from the atoms to their Maker.
Accepting here the leadership of Kant, I doubt the legitimacy of  Maxwell's 
logic; but it is impossible not to feel the ethic glow with which his lecture 
concludes. There is, moreover, a very noble strain of eloquence in his 
description of the steadfastness of the atoms: ÅENatural causes, as we know, are 
at work, which tend to modify, if they do not at length destroy, all the 
arrangements and dimensions of the earth and the whole solar system. But though 
in the course of ages catastrophes have occurred and may yet occur in the 
heavens, though ancient systems may be dissolved and new systems evolved out of 
their ruins, the molecules out of which these systems are builtóthe foundation 
stones of the material universeóremain unbroken and unworn.'
The atomic doctrine, in whole or in part, was entertained by Bacon, Descartes, 
Hobbes, Locke, Newton, Boyle, and their successors, until the chemical law of 
multiple proportions enabled Dalton to confer upon it an entirely new 
significance. In our day there are secessions from the theory, but it still 
stands firm. Loschmidt, Stoney, and Sir William Thomson have sought to determine 
the sizes of the atoms, or rather to fix the limits between which their sizes 
lie; while only last year the discourses of Williamson and  Maxwell illustrate 
the pres-
[page 27]
ent hold of the doctrine upon the foremost scientific minds. In fact, it may be 
doubted whether, wanting this fundamental conception, a theory of the material 
universe is capable of scientific statement.
Ninety years subsequent to Gassendi the doctrine of bodily instruments, as it 
may be called, assumed immense importance in the hands of Bishop Butler, who, in 
his famous 'Analogy of Religion,' developed, from his own point of view, and 
with consummate sagacity, a similar idea. The Bishop still influences superior 
minds; and it will repay us to dwell for a moment on his views. He draws the 
sharpest distinction between our real selves and our bodily instruments. He does 
not, as far as I remember, use the word soul, possibly because the term was so 
hackneyed in his day as it had been for many generations previously. But he 
speaks of 'living powers,' 'perceiving' or 'percipient powers,' 'moving agents,' 
'ourselves,' in the same sense as we should employ the term soul. He dwells upon 
the fact that limbs may be removed, and mortal diseases assail the body, the 
mind, almost up to the moment of death, remaining clear. He refers to sleep and 
to swoon, where the 'living powers' are suspended but not destroyed. He 
considers it quite as easy to conceive of existence out of our bodies as in 
them: that we may animate a succession of bodies, the dissolution of all of them 
having no more tendency to dissolve our real selves, or 'deprive us of living 
facultiesóthe faculties of perception and actionóthan the dissolution of any 
foreign matter which we are capable of receiving impressions from, or making use 
of for the common occasions of life.' This is the key of the Bishop's position; 
'our organized bodies are no more a part of ourselves than any other matter 
around us.' In proof of this he 
[page 28]
calls attention to the use of glasses, which 'prepare objects' for the 
'percipient power' exactly as the eye does. The eye itself is no more percipient 
than the glass; is quite as much the instrument of the true self, and also as 
foreign to the true self, as the glass is.' And if we see with our eyes only in 
the same manner as we do with glasses, the like may justly be concluded from 
analogy of all our senses.'
Lucretius, as you are aware, reached a precisely opposite conclusion; and it 
certainly would be interesting, if not profitable, to us all, to hear what he 
would or could urge in opposition to the reasoning of the Bishop. As a brief 
discussion of the point will enable us to see the bearings of an important 
question, I will here permit a disciple of Lucretius to try the strength of the 
Bishop's position, and then allow the Bishop to retaliate, with the view of 
rolling back, if he can, the difficulty upon Lucretius.
The argument might proceed in this fashion: ÅE'Subjected to the test of mental 
presentation (Vorstellung), your views, most honoured prelate, would present to 
many minds a great, if not an insuperable difficulty. You speak of "living 
powers," "percipient or perceiving powers," and "ourselves;" but can you form a 
mental picture of any one of these apart from the organism through which it is 
supposed to act? Test yourself honestly, and see whether you possess any faculty 
that would enable you to form such a conception. The true self has a local 
habitation in each of us; thus localized, must it not possess a form? If so, 
what form? Have you ever for a moment realized it? When a leg is amputated the 
body is divided into two parts; is the true self in both of them or in one? 
Thomas Aquinas might say in both; but not you, for you appeal to the 
consciousness associated with one of the two parts to prove that the 
[page 29]
other is foreign matter. Is consciousness, then, a necessary element of the true 
self? If so, what do you say to the case of the whole body being deprived of 
consciousness? If not, then on what grounds do you deny any portion of the true 
self to the severed limb? It seems very singular that, from the beginning to the 
end of your admirable book (and no one admires its sober strength more than I 
do), you never once mention the brain or nervous system. You begin at one end of 
the body and show that its parts may be removed without prejudice to the 
perceiving power. What if you begin at the other end, and remove, instead of the 
leg, the brain? The body, as before, is divided into two parts; but both are now 
in the same predicament, and neither can be appealed to to prove that the other 
is foreign matter. Or, instead of going so far as to remove the brain itself, 
let a certain portion of its bony covering be removed, and let a rhythmic series 
of pressures and relaxations of pressure be applied to the soft substance. At 
every pressure, "the faculties of perception and of action" vanish; at every 
relaxation of pressure they are restored. Where, during the intervals of 
pressure, is the perceiving power? I once had the discharge of a large Leyden 
battery passed unexpectedly through me: I felt nothing, but was simply blotted 
out of conscious existence for a sensible interval. Where was my true self 
during that interval? Men who have recovered from lightning-stroke have been 
much longer in the same state; and indeed in cases of ordinary concussion of the 
brain, days may elapse during which no experience is registered in 
consciousness. Where is the man himself during the period of insensibility? You 
may say that I beg the question when I assume the man to have been unconscious, 
that he was really conscious all the time, and has simply forgotten what had 
occurred to him. In 
[page 30]
reply to this, I can only say that no one need shrink from the worst tortures 
that superstition ever invented if only so felt and so remembered. I do not 
think your theory of instruments goes at all to the bottom of the matter. A 
telegraph-operator has his instruments, by means of which he converses with the 
world; our bodies possess a nervous system, which plays a similar part between 
the perceiving power and external things. Cut the wires of the operator, break 
his battery, demagnetize his needle: by this means you certainly sever his 
connexion with the world; but inasmuch as these are real instruments, their 
destruction does not touch the man who uses them. The operator survives, and he 
knows that he survives. What is it, I would ask, in the human system that 
answers to this conscious survival of the operator when the battery of the brain 
is so disturbed as to produce insensibility, or when it is destroyed altogether?
'Another consideration, which you may consider slight, presses upon me with some 
force. The brain may change from health to disease, and through such a change 
the most exemplary man may be converted into a debauchee or a murderer. My very 
noble and approved good master had, as you know, threatenings of lewdness 
introduced into his brain by his jealous wife's philter; and sooner than permit 
himself to run even the risk of yielding to these base promptings he slew 
himself. How could the hand of Lucretius have been thus turned against himself 
if the real Lucretius remained as before? Can the brain or can it not act in 
this distempered way without the intervention of the immortal reason? If it can, 
then it is a prime mover which requires only healthy regulation to render it 
reasonably self-acting, and there is no apparent need of your immortal reason at 
all. If it cannot, then the immortal reason, by its mischievous activity in 
operating upon a broken instrument, must have the credit 
[page 31]
of committing every imaginable extravagance and crime. I think, if you will 
allow me to say so, that the gravest consequences are likely to flow from your 
estimate of the body. To regard the brain as you would a staff or an eyeglassóto 
shut your eyes to all its mystery, to the perfect correlation of its condition 
and our consciousness, to the fact that a slight excess or defect of blood in it 
produces the very swoon to which you refer, and that in relation to it our meat 
and drink and air and exercise have a perfectly transcendental value and 
significanceóto forget all this does, I think, open a way to innumerable errors 
in our habits of life, and may possibly in some cases initiate and foster that 
very disease, and consequent mental ruin, which a wiser appreciation of this 
mysterious organ would have avoided.'
I can imagine the Bishop thoughtful after hearing this argument. He was not the 
man to allow anger to mingle with the consideration of a point of this kind. 
After due reflection, and having strengthened himself by that honest 
contemplation of the facts which was habitual with him, and which includes the 
desire to give even adverse facts their due weight, I can suppose the Bishop to 
proceed thus: ÅEYou will remember that in the "Analogy of Religion," of which you 
have so kindly spoken, I did not profess to prove anything absolutely, and that 
I over and over again acknowledged and insisted on the smallness of our 
knowledge, or rather the depth of our ignorance, as regards the whole system of 
the universe. My object was to show my deistical friends, who set forth so 
eloquently the beauty and beneficence of Nature and the Ruler thereof, while 
they had nothing but scorn for the so-called absurdities of the Christian 
scheme, that they were in no better condition than we were, and that, for every 
difficulty found upon our side, quite as great a difficulty was to be found upon 
theirs. I 
[page 32]
will now, with your permission, adopt a similar line of argument. You are a 
Lucretian, and from the combination and separation of insensate atoms deduce all 
terrestrial things, including organic forms and their phenomena. Let me tell 
you, in the first instance, how far I am prepared to go with you. I admit that 
you can build crystalline forms out of this play of molecular force; that the 
diamond, amethyst, and snow-star are truly wonderful structures which are thus 
produced. I will go further and acknowledge that even a tree or flower might in 
this way be organized. Nay, if you can show me an animal without sensation, I 
will concede to you that it also might be put together by the suitable play of 
molecular force.
'Thus far our way is clear; but now comes my difficulty. Your atoms are 
individually without sensation, much more are they without intelligence. May I 
ask you, then, to try your hand upon this problem? Take your dead hydrogen 
atoms, your dead oxygen atoms, your dead carbon atoms, your dead nitrogen atoms, 
your dead phosphorus atoms, and all the other atoms, dead as grains of shot, of 
which the brain is formed. Imagine them separate and sensationless, observe them 
running together and forming all imaginable combinations. This, as a purely 
mechanical process, is seeable by the mind. But can you see, or dream, or in any 
way imagine, how out of that mechanical act, and from those individually dead 
atoms, sensation, thought, and emotion are to arise? Are you likely to extract 
Homer out of the rattling of dice, or the Differential Calculus out of the clash 
of billiard-balls? I am not all bereft of this Vorstellungs-Kraft of which you 
speak, nor am I, like so many of my brethren, a mere vacuum as regards 
scientific knowledge. I can follow a particle of musk until it reaches the 
olfactory nerve; I can 
[page 33]
follow the waves of sound until their tremors reach the water of the labyrinth 
and set the otoliths and Corti's fibres in motion; I can also visualize the 
waves of ether as they cross the eye and hit the retina. Nay more, I am able to 
pursue to the central organ the motion thus imparted at the periphery, and to 
see in idea the very molecules of the brain thrown into tremors. My insight is 
not baffled by these physical processes. What baffles and bewilders me, is the 
notion that from those physical tremors things so utterly incongruous with them 
as sensation, thought, and emotion can be derived. You may say, or think, that 
this issue of consciousness from the clash of atoms is not more incongruous than 
the flash of light from the union of oxygen and hydrogen. But I beg to say that 
it is. For such incongruity as the flash possesses is that which I now force 
upon your attention. The flash is an affair of consciousness, the objective 
counterpart of which is a vibration. It is a flash only by your interpretation. 
You are the cause of the apparent incongruity and you are the thing that puzzles 
me. I need not remind you that the great Leibnitz felt the difficulty which I 
feel, and that to get rid of this monstrous deduction of life from death he 
displaced your atoms by his monads, which were more or less perfect mirrors of 
the universe, and out of the summation and integration of which he supposed all 
the phenomena of lifeósentient, intellectual, and emotionalóto arise.
'Your difficulty, then, as I see you are ready to admit, is quite as great as 
mine. You cannot satisfy the human understanding in its demand for logical 
continuity between molecular processes and the phenomena of consciousness. This 
is a rock on which materialism must inevitably split whenever it pretends to be 
a complete 
[page 34]
philosophy of life. What is the moral, my Lucretian? You and I are not likely to 
indulge in ill-temper in the discussion of these great topics, where we see so 
much room for honest differences of opinion. But there are people of less wit or 
more bigotry (I say it with humility) on both sides, who are ever ready to 
mingle anger and vituperation with such discussions. There are, for example, 
writers of note and influence at the present day who are not ashamed to assume 
the "deep personal sin" of a great logician to be the cause of his unbelief in a 
theologic dogma. And there are others who hold that we, who cherish our noble 
Bible, wrought as it has been into the constitution of our forefathers, and by 
inheritance into us, must necessarily be hypocritical and insincere. Let us 
disavow and discountenance such people, cherishing the unswerving faith that 
what is good and true in both our arguments will be preserved for the benefit of 
humanity, while all that is bad or false will disappear.'
I hold the Bishop's reasoning to be unanswerable, and his liberality to be 
worthy of imitation.
It is worth remarking that in one respect the Bishop was a product of his age. 
Long previous to his day the nature of the soul had been so favourite and 
general a topic of discussion, that, when the students of the University of 
Paris wished to know the leanings of a new Professor, they at once requested him 
to lecture upon the soul. About the time of 
[page 35]
Bishop Butler the question was not only agitated but extended. It was seen by 
the clear-witted men who entered this arena that many of their best arguments 
applied equally to brutes and men. The Bishop's arguments were of this 
character. He saw it, admitted it, accepted the consequences, and boldly 
embraced the whole animal world in his scheme of immortality.
Bishop Butler accepted with unwavering trust the chronology of the Old 
Testament, describing it as 'confirmed by the natural and civil history of the 
world, collected from common historians, from the state of the earth, and from 
the late inventions of arts and sciences.' These words mark progress; and they 
must seem somewhat hoary to the Bishop's successors of to-day. 15 It is hardly 
necessary to inform you that since his time the domain of the naturalist has 
been immensely extendedóthe whole science of geology, with its astounding 
revelations regarding the life of the ancient earth, having been created. The 
rigidity of old conceptions has been relaxed, the public mind being rendered 
gradually tolerant of the idea that not for six thousand, nor for sixty 
thousand, nor for six thousand thousand thousand, but for aeons embracing untold 
millions of years, this earth has been the theatre of life and death. The riddle 
of the rocks has been read by the geologist and palaeontologist, from 
subcambrian depths to the deposits thickening over the sea-bottoms of to-day. 
And upon the leaves of that stone book are, as you know, stamped the characters, 
plainer and surer than those formed by the ink of history, which carry the mind 
back into abysses of past time compared with which the periods which satisfied 
Bishop Butler cease to have a visual angle.
The lode of discovery once struck, those petrified forms in which life was at 
one time active increased to multitudes and demanded classification. They were 
grouped in genera, species, and varieties, according to the degree of similarity 
subsisting between them. Thus confusion was avoided, each object being found in 
the 
15. Only to some; for there are dignitaries who even now speak of the earth's 
rocky crust as so much building material prepared for man at the Creation. 
Surely it is time that this loose language should cease.
[page 36]
pigeon-hole appropriated to it and to its fellows of similar morphological or 
physiological character. The general fact soon became evident that none but the 
simplest forms of life lie lowest down, that as we climb higher among the 
super-imposed strata more perfect forms appear. The change, however, from form 
to form was not continuous, but by stepsósome small, some great. 'A section,' 
says Mr. Huxley, 'a hundred feet thick will exhibit at different heights a dozen 
species of Ammonite, none of which passes beyond its particular zone of 
limestone, or clay, into the zone below it, or into that above it.' In the 
presence of such facts it was not possible to avoid the question: óHave these 
forms, showing, though in broken stages and with many irregularities, this 
unmistakable general advance, been subjected to no continuous law of growth or 
variation? Had our education been purely scientific, or had it been sufficiently 
detached from influences which, however ennobling in another domain, have always 
proved hindrances and delusions when introduced as factors into the domain of 
physics, the scientific mind never could have swerved from the search for a law 
of growth, or allowed itself to accept the anthropomorphism which regarded each 
successive stratum as a kind of mechanic's bench for the manufacture of new 
species out of all relation to the old.
Biassed, however, by their previous education, the great majority of naturalists 
invoked a special creative act to account for the appearance of each new group 
of organisms. Doubtless there were numbers who were clear-headed enough to see 
that this was no explanation at all, that in point of fact it was an attempt, by 
the introduction of a greater difficulty, to account for a less. But having 
nothing to offer in the way of explanation, they
[page 37]
for the most part held their peace. Still the thoughts of reflecting men 
naturally and necessarily simmered round the question. De Maillet, a 
contemporary of Newton, has been brought into notice by Professor Huxley as one 
who 'had a notion of the modifiability of living forms.' In my frequent 
conversations with him, the late Sir Benjamin Brodie, a man of highly 
philosophic mind, often drew my attention to the fact that, as early as 1794, 
Charles Darwin's grandfather was the pioneer of Charles Darwin.16 In 1801, and 
in subsequent years, the celebrated  Lamarck, who produced so profound an 
impression on the public mind through the vigorous exposition of his views by 
the author of the  'Vestiges of Creation,' endeavoured to show the development 
of species out of changes of habit and external condition. In 1813 Dr. Wells, 
the founder of our present theory of Dew, read before the Royal Society a paper 
in which, to use the words of Mr. Darwin, 'he distinctly recognises the 
principle of natural selection; and this is the first recognition that has been 
indicated.' The thoroughness and skill with which Wells pursued his work, and 
the obvious independence of his character, rendered him long ago a favourite 
with me; and it gave me the liveliest pleasure to alight upon this additional 
testimony to his penetration. Professor Grant, Mr. Patrick Matthew, Von Buch, 
the author of the 'Vestiges,' D'Halloy, and others,17 by the enunciation of 
opinions more or less clear and correct, showed that the question had been 
fermenting long prior to the year 1858, when Mr.  Darwin and Mr.  Wallace 
simultaneously but 
16. Zoonomia, vol. i. pp. 500-510.
17. In 1855 Mr. Herbert Spencer (Principles of Psychology, 2nd edit. vol. i. p. 
465) expressed 'the belief that life under all its forms has arisen by an 
unbroken evolution, and through the instrumentality of what are called natural 
causes. ' 
[page 38]
independently placed their closely concurrent views upon the subject before the 
Linnean Society.
These papers were followed in 1859 by the publication of the first edition of 
'The Origin of Species.' All great things come slowly to the birth. Copernicus, 
as I informed you, pondered his great work for thirty-three years. Newton for 
nearly twenty years kept the idea of Gravitation before his mind; for twenty 
years also he dwelt upon his discovery of Fluxions, and doubtless would have 
continued to make it the object of his private thought had he not found that 
Leibnitz was upon his track. Darwin for two and twenty years pondered the 
problem of the origin of species, and doubtless he would have continued to do so 
had he not found Wallace upon his track. 18 A concentrated but full and powerful 
epitome of his labours was the consequence. The book was by no means an easy 
one; and probably not one in every score of those who then attacked it had read 
its pages through, or were competent to grasp their significance if they had. I 
do not say this merely to discredit them; for there were in those days some 
really eminent scientific men, entirely raised above the heat of popular 
prejudice, willing to accept any conclusion that science had to offer, provided 
it was duly backed by fact and argument, and who entirely mistook Mr. Darwin's 
views. In fact, the work needed an expounder; and it found one in Mr. Huxley. I 
know nothing more admirable in the way of scientific exposition than those early 
articles of his on the origin of species. He swept the curve of discussion 
through the really significant points of the subject, enriched his exposition 
with profound original remarks and reflections, often summing up in a single 
pithy sentence an argument which a less compact 
18. The behaviour of Mr. Wallace in relation to this subject has been dignified 
in the highest degree.
[page 39]
mind would have spread over pages. But there is one impression made by the book 
itself which no exposition of it, however luminous, can convey; and that is the 
impression of the vast amount of labour, both of observation and of thought, 
implied in its production. Let us glance at its principles.
It is conceded on all hands that what are called varieties are continually 
produced. The rule is probably without exception. No chick and no child is in 
all respects and particulars the counterpart of its brother and sister; and in 
such differences we have 'variety' incipient. No naturalist could tell how far 
this variation could be carried; but the great mass of them held that never by 
any amount of internal or external change, nor by the mixture of both, could the 
offspring of the same progenitor so far deviate from each other as to constitute 
different species. The function of the experimental philosopher is to combine 
the conditions of nature and to produce her results; and this was the method of 
Darwin. 19 He made himself acquainted with what could, without any manner of 
doubt, be done in the way of producing variation. He associated himself with 
pigeon-fanciersóbought, begged, kept, and observed every breed that he could 
obtain. Though derived from a common stock, the diversities of these pigeons 
were such that 'a score of them might be chosen which, if shown to an 
ornithologist, and he were told that they were wild birds, would certainly be 
ranked by him as well-defined species.' The simple principle which guides the 
pigeon-fancier, as it does the cattle-breeder, is the selection of some variety 
that strikes his fancy, and the propagation 
19. The first step only towards experimental demonstration has been taken. 
Experiments now begun might, a couple of centuries hence, furnish data of 
incalculable value, which ought to be supplied to the science of the future.
[page 40]
of this variety by inheritance. With his eye still directed to the particular 
appearance which he wishes to exaggerate, he selects it as it reappears in 
successive broods, and thus adds increment to increment until an astonishing 
amount of divergence from the parent type is effected. The breeder in this case 
does not produce the elements of the variation. He simply observes them, and by 
selection adds them together until the required result has been obtained. 'No 
man,' says Mr. Darwin, 'would ever try to make a fantail till he saw a pigeon 
with a tail developed in some slight degree in an unusual manner, or a pouter 
until he saw a pigeon with a crop of unusual size.' Thus nature gives the hint, 
man acts upon it, and by the law of inheritance exaggerates the deviation. 
Having thus satisfied himself by indubitable facts that the organization of an 
animal or of a plant (for precisely the same treatment applies to plants) is to 
some extent plastic, he passes from variation under domestication to variation 
under nature. Hitherto we have dealt with the adding together of small changes 
by the conscious selection of man. Can Nature thus select? Mr. Darwin's answer 
is, 'Assuredly she can.' The number of living things produced is far in excess 
of the number that can be supported; hence at some period or other of their 
lives there must be a struggle for existence; and what is the infallible result? 
If one organism were a perfect copy of the other in regard to strength, skill, 
and agility, external conditions would decide. But this is not the case. Here we 
have the fact of variety offering itself to nature, as in the former instance it 
offered itself to man; and those varieties which are least competent to cope 
with surrounding conditions will infallibly give way to those that are most 
competent. To use a familiar proverb, the weakest comes to the wall. But the 
triumphant fraction again breeds to overproduction, 
[page 41]
transmitting the qualities which secured its maintenance, but transmitting them 
in different degrees. The struggle for food again supervenes, and those to whom 
the favourable quality has been transmitted in excess will assuredly triumph. It 
is easy to see that we have here the addition of increments favourable to the 
individual still more rigorously carried out than in the case of domestication; 
for not only are unfavourable specimens not selected by nature, but they are 
destroyed. This is what Mr. Darwin calls 'Natural Selection,' which 'acts by the 
preservation and accumulation of small inherited modifications, each profitable 
to the preserved being.' With this idea he interpenetrates and leavens the vast 
store of facts that he and others have collected. We cannot, without shutting 
our eyes through fear or prejudice, fail to see that Darwin is here dealing, not 
with imaginary, but with true causes; nor can we fail to discern what vast 
modifications may be produced by natural selection in periods sufficiently long. 
Each individual increment may resemble what mathematicians call a 'differential' 
(a quantity indefinitely small); but definite and great changes may obviously be 
produced by the integration of these infinitesimal quantities through 
practically infinite time.
If Darwin, like Bruno, rejects the notion of creative power acting after human 
fashion, it certainly is not because he is unacquainted with the numberless 
exquisite adaptations on which this notion of a supernatural artificer has been 
founded. His book is a repository of the most startling facts of this 
description. Take the marvellous observation which he cites from Dr. Cr&uuml;ger, 
where a bucket with an aperture, serving as a spout, is formed in an orchid. 
Bees visit the flower: in eager search of material for their combs they push 
each other into the bucket, the drenched ones escaping from their involuntary 
[page 42]
bath by the spout. Here they rub their backs against the viscid stigma of the 
flower and obtain glue; then against the pollen-masses, which are thus stuck to 
the back of the bee and carried away. 'When the bee, so provided, flies to 
another flower, or to the same flower a second time, and is pushed by its 
comrades into the bucket, and then crawls out by the passage, the pollen-mass 
upon its back necessarily comes first into contact with the viscid stigma,' 
which takes up the pollen; and this is how that orchid is fertilized. Or take 
this other case of the Catasetum. 'Bees visit these flowers in order to gnaw the 
labellum; in doing this they inevitably touch a long, tapering, sensitive 
projection. This, when touched, transmits a sensation or vibration to a certain 
membrane, which is instantly ruptured, setting free a spring, by which the 
pollen-mass is shot forth like an arrow in the right direction, and adheres by 
its viscid extremity to the back of the bee.' In this way the fertilising pollen 
is spread abroad.
It is the mind thus stored with the choicest materials of the teleologist that 
rejects teleology, seeking to refer these wonders to natural cases. They 
illustrate, according to him, the method of nature, not the 'technic' of a 
man-like Artificer. The beauty of flowers is due to natural selection. Those 
that distinguish themselves by vividly contrasting colours from the surrounding 
green leaves are most readily seen, most frequently visited by insects, most 
often fertilized, and hence most favoured by natural selection. Coloured berries 
also readily attract the attention of birds and beasts, which feed upon them, 
spread their manured seeds abroad, thus giving trees and shrubs possessing such 
berries a greater chance in the struggle for existence.
With profound analytic and synthetic skill, Mr. Darwin investigates the 
cell-making instinct of the hive-bee. His 
[page 43]
method of dealing with it is representative. He falls back from the more 
perfectly to the less perfectly developed instinctófrom the hive-bee to the 
humble bee, which uses its own cocoon as a comb, and to classes of bees of 
intermediate skill, endeavouring to show how the passage might be gradually made 
from the lowest to the highest. The saving of wax is the most important point in 
the economy of bees. Twelve to fifteen pounds of dry sugar are said to be needed 
for the secretion of a single pound of wax. The quantities of nectar necessary 
for the wax must therefore be vast, and every improvement of constructive 
instinct which results in the saving of wax is a direct profit to the insect's 
life. The time that would otherwise be devoted to the making of wax is now 
devoted to the gathering and storing of honey for winter food. He passes from 
the humble bee with its rude cells, through the Melipona with its more artistic 
cells, to the hive-bee with its astonishing architecture. The bees place 
themselves at equal distances apart upon the wax, sweep and excavate equal 
spheres round the selected points. The spheres intersect, and the planes of 
intersection are built up with thin laminae. Hexagonal cells are thus formed. 
This mode of treating such questions is, as I have said, representative. He 
habitually retires from the more perfect and complex to the less perfect and 
simple, and carries you with him through stages of perfecting, adds increment to 
increment of infinitesimal change, and in this way gradually breaks down your 
reluctance to admit that the exquisite climax of the whole could be a result of 
natural selection.
Mr. Darwin shirks no difficulty; and, saturated as the subject was with his own 
thought, he must have known better than his critics the weakness as well as the 
strength of his theory. This of course would be of little avail 
[page 44]
were his object a temporary dialectic victory instead of the establishment of a 
truth which he means to be everlasting. But he takes no pains to disguise the 
weakness he has discerned; nay, he takes every pains to bring it into the 
strongest light. His vast resources enable him to cope with objections started 
by himself and others, so as to leave the final impression upon the reader's 
mind that, if they be not completely answered, they certainly are not fatal. 
Their negative force being thus destroyed, you are free to be influenced by the 
vast positive mass of evidence he is able to bring before you. This largeness of 
knowledge and readiness of resource render Mr. Darwin the most terrible of 
antagonists. Accomplished naturalists have levelled heavy and sustained 
criticisms against himónot always with the view of fairly weighing his theory, 
but with the express intention of exposing its weak points only. This does not 
irritate him. He treats every objection with a soberness and thoroughness which 
even Bishop Butler might be proud to imitate, surrounding each fact with its 
appropriate detail, placing it in its proper relations, and usually giving it a 
significance which, as long as it was kept isolated, failed to appear. This is 
done without a trace of ill-temper. He moves over the subject with the 
passionless strength of a glacier; and the grinding of the rocks is not always 
without a counterpart in the logical pulverization of the objector.
But though in handling this mighty theme all passion has been stilled, there is 
an emotion of the intellect incident to the discernment of new truth which often 
colours and warms the pages of Mr. Darwin. His success has been great; and this 
implies not only the solidity of his work, but the preparedness of the public 
mind for such a revelation. On this head a remark of Agassiz impressed me more 
than anything else. Sprung from a race of theologians, 
[page 45]
this celebrated man combated to the last the theory of natural selection. One of 
the many times I had the pleasure of meeting him in the United States was at Mr. 
Winthrop's beautiful residence at Brookline, near Boston. Rising from luncheon, 
we all halted as if by a common impulse in front of a window, and continued 
there a discussion which had been started at table. The maple was in its autumn 
glory; and the exquisite beauty of the scene outside seemed, in my case, to 
interpenetrate without disturbance the intellectual action. Earnestly, almost 
sadly, Agassiz turned, and said to the gentleman standing round, 'I confess that 
I was not prepared to see this theory received as it has been by the best 
intellects of our time. Its success is greater than I could have thought 
possible.'
In our day grand generalizations have been reached. The theory of the origin of 
species is but one of them. Another, of still wider grasp and more radical 
significance, is the doctrine of the Conservation of Energy, the ultimate 
philosophical issues of which are as yet but dimly seenÅEthat doctrine which 
'binds nature fast in fate' to an extent not hitherto recognized, exacting from 
every antecedent its equivalent consequent, from every consequent its equivalent 
antecedent, and bringing vital as well as physical phenomena under the dominion 
of that law of causal connexion which, so far as the human understanding has yet 
pierced, asserts itself everywhere in nature. Long in advance of all definite 
experiment upon the subject, the constancy and indestructibility of matter had 
been affirmed; and all subsequent experience justified the affirmation. Later 
researches extended the attribute of indestructibility to force. This idea, 
applied in the first instance to inorganic, rapidly embraced organic nature. The 
vegetable world, though drawing almost all its 
[page 46]
nutriment from invisible sources, was proved incompetent to generate anew either 
matter or force. Its matter is for the most part transmuted gas; its force 
transformed solar force. The animal world was proved to be equally uncreative, 
all its motive energies being referred to the combustion of its food. The 
activity of each animal as a whole was proved to be the transferred activity of 
its molecules. The muscles were shown to be stores of mechanical force, 
potential until unlocked by the nerves, and then resulting in muscular 
contractions. The speed at which messages fly to and fro along the nerves was 
determined, and found to be, not as had been previously supposed, equal to that 
of light or electricity, but less than the speed of a flying eagle.
This was the work of the physicist: then came the conquests of the comparative 
anatomist and physiologist, revealing the structure of every animal, and the 
function of every organ in the whole biological series, from the lowest zoophyte 
up to man. The nervous system had been made the object of profound and continued 
study, the wonderful and, at bottom, entirely mysterious, controlling power 
which it exercises over the whole organism, physical and mental, being 
recognized more and more. Thought could not be kept back from a subject so 
profoundly suggestive. Besides the physical life dealt with by Mr. Darwin, there 
is a psychical life presenting similar gradations, and asking equally for a 
solution. How are the different grades and order of Mind to be accounted for? 
What is the principle of growth of that mysterious power which on our planet 
culminates in Reason? These are questions which, though not thrusting themselves 
so forcibly upon the attention of the general public, had not only occupied many 
reflecting minds, but had been formally broached by one of them before the 
'Origin of Species' appeared.
[page 47]
With the mass of materials furnished by the physicist and physiologist in his 
hands, Mr. Herbert Spencer, twenty years ago, sought to graft upon this basis a 
system of psychology; and two years ago a second and greatly amplified edition 
of his work appeared. Those who have occupied themselves with the beautiful 
experiments of Plateau will remember that when two spherules of olive-oil, 
suspended in a mixture of alcohol and water of the same density as the oil, are 
brought together, they do not immediately unite. Something like a pellicle 
appears to be formed around the drops, the rupture of which is immediately 
followed by the coalescence of the globules into one. There are organisms whose 
vital actions are almost as purely physical as that of these drops of oil. They 
come into contact and fuse themselves thus together. From such organisms to 
others a shade higher, and from these to others a shade higher still, and on 
through an ever-ascending series, Mr. Spencer conducts his argument. There are 
two obvious factors to be here taken into accountóthe creature and the medium in 
which it lives, or, as it is often expressed, the organism and its environment. 
Mr. Spencer's fundamental principle is that between these two factors there is 
incessant interaction. The organism is played upon by the environment, and is 
modified to meet the requirements of the environment. Life he defines to be 'a 
continuous adjustment of internal relations to external relations.'
In the lowest organisms we have a kind of tactual sense diffused over the entire 
body; then, through impressions from without and their corresponding 
adjustments, special portions of the surface become more responsive to stimuli 
than others. The senses are nascent, the basis of all of them being that simple 
tactual sense which the sage Democritus recognised 2,300 years 
[page 48]
ago as their common progenitor. The action of light, in the first instance, 
appears to be a mere disturbance of the chemical processes in the animal 
organism, similar to that which occurs in the leaves of plants. By degrees the 
action becomes localized in a few pigment-cells, more sensitive to light than 
the surrounding tissue. The eye is here incipient. At first it is merely capable 
of revealing differences of light and shade produced by bodies close at hand. 
Followed as the interception of the light is in almost all cases by the contact 
of the closely adjacent opaque body, sight in this condition becomes a kind of 
'anticipatory touch.' The adjustment continues; a slight bulging out of the 
epidermis over the pigment-granules supervenes. A lens is incipient, and, 
through the operation of infinite adjustments, at length reaches the perfection 
that it displays in the hawk and eagle. So of the other senses; they are special 
differentiations of a tissue which was originally vaguely sensitive all over.
With the development of the senses the adjustments between the organism and its 
environment gradually extend in space, a multiplication of experiences and a 
corresponding modification of conduct being the result. The adjustments also 
extend in time, covering continually greater intervals. Along with this 
extension in space and time the adjustments also increase in specialty and 
complexity, passing through the various grades of brute life, and prolonging 
themselves into the domain of reason. Very striking are Mr. Spencer's remarks 
regarding the influence of the sense of touch upon the development of 
intelligence. This is, so to say, the mother-tongue of all the senses, into 
which they must be translated to be of service to the organism. Hence its 
importance. The parrot is the most intelligent of birds, and its tactual power 
is also greatest. From this sense it gets know-
[page 49]
ledge unattainable by birds which cannot employ their feet as hands. The 
elephant is the most sagacious of quadrupedsóits tactual range and skill, and the 
consequent multiplication of experiences, which it owes to its wonderfully 
adaptable trunk, being the basis of its sagacity. Feline animals, for a similar 
cause, are more sagacious than hoofed animalsóatonement being to some extent 
made, in the case of the horse, by the possession of sensitive prehensile lips. 
In the Primates the evolution of intellect and the evolution of tactual 
appendages go hand in hand. In the most intelligent anthropoid apes we find the 
tactual range and delicacy greatly augmented, new avenues of knowledge being 
thus open to the animal. Man crowns the edifice here, not only in virtue of his 
own manipulatory power, but through the enormous extension of his range of 
experience, by the invention of instruments of precision, which serve as 
supplemental senses and supplemental limbs. The reciprocal action of these is 
finely described and illustrated. That chastened intellectual emotion to which I 
have referred in connexion with Mr. Darwin is not absent in Mr. Spencer. His 
illustrations possess at times exceeding vividness and force; and from his style 
on such occasions it is to be inferred that the ganglia of this Apostle of the 
Understanding are sometimes the seat of a nascent poetic thrill.
It is a fact of supreme importance that actions the performance of which at 
first requires even painful effort and deliberation may by habit be rendered 
automatic. Witness the slow learning of its letters by a child, and the 
subsequent facility of reading in a man, when each group of letters which forms 
a word is instantly, and without effort, fused to a single perception. Instance 
the billiard-player, whose muscles of hand and eye, when he reaches the 
perfection of his art, are unconsciously 
[page 50] 
co&ouml;rdinated. Instance the musician, who, by practice, is enabled to fuse a 
multitude of arrangements, auditory, tactual, and muscular, into a process of 
automatic manipulation. Combining such facts with the doctrine of hereditary 
transmission, we reach a theory of Instinct. A chick, after coming out of the 
egg, balances itself correctly, runs about, picks up food, thus showing that it 
possesses a power of directing its movements to definite ends. How did the chick 
learn this very complex coordination of eye, muscles, and beak? It has not been 
individually taught; its personal experience is nil; but it has the benefit of 
ancestral experience. In its inherited organization are registered all the 
powers which it displays at birth. So also as regards the instinct of the 
hive-bee, already referred to. The distance at which the insects stand apart 
when they sweep their hemispheres and build their cells is 'organically 
remembered.'
Man also carries with him the physical texture of his ancestry, as well as the 
inherited intellect bound up with it. The defects of intelligence during infancy 
and youth are probably less due to a lack of individual experience than to the 
fact that in early life the cerebral organization is still incomplete. The 
period necessary for completion varies with the race and with the individual. As 
a round shot outstrips a rifled one on quitting the muzzle of the gun, so the 
lower race in childhood may outstrip the higher. But the higher eventually 
overtakes the lower, and surpasses it in range. As regards individuals, we do 
not always find the precocity of youth prolonged to mental power in maturity; 
while the dulness of boyhood is sometimes strikingly contrasted with the 
intellectual energy of after years. Newton, when a boy, was weakly, and he 
showed no particular aptitude at school; but in his eighteenth year he went to 
Cambridge, and soon afterwards aston-
[page 51]
ished his teachers by his power of dealing with geometrical problems. During his 
quiet youth his brain was slowly preparing itself to be the organ of those 
energies which he subsequently displayed.
By myriad blows (to use a Lucretian phrase) the image and superscription of the 
external world are stamped as states of consciousness upon the organism, the 
depth of the impression depending upon the number of the blows. When two or more 
phenomena occur in the environment invariably together, they are stamped to the 
same depth or to the same relief, and indissolubly connected. And here we come 
to the threshold of a great question. Seeing that he could in no way rid himself 
of the consciousness of Space and Time, Kant assumed them to be necessary 'forms 
of intuition,' the moulds and shapes into which our intuitions are thrown, 
belonging to ourselves solely and without objective existence. With unexpected 
power and success Mr. Spencer brings the hereditary experience theory, as he 
holds it, to bear upon this question. 'If there exist certain external relations 
which are experienced by all organisms at all instants of their waking 
livesórelations which are absolutely constant and universalóthere will be 
established answering internal relations that are absolutely constant and 
universal. Such relations we have in those of Space and Time. As the substratum 
of all other relations of the Non-Ego, they must be responded to by conceptions 
that are the substrata of all other relations in the Ego. Being the constant and 
infinitely repeated elements of thought, they must become the automatic elements 
of thoughtóthe elements of thought which it is impossible to get rid ofóthe "forms 
of intuition."'
Throughout this application and extension of the 'Law of Inseparable 
Association,' Mr. Spencer stands upon his 
[page 52]
own ground, invoking, instead of the experiences of the individual, the 
registered experiences of the race. His overthrow of the restriction of 
experience to the individual is, I think, complete. That restriction ignores the 
power of organizing experience furnished at the outset to each individual; it 
ignores the different degrees of this power possessed by different races and by 
different individuals of the same race. Were there not in the human brain a 
potency antecedent to all experience, a dog or cat ought to be as capable of 
education as a man. These predetermined internal relations are independent of 
the experiences of the individual. The human brain is the 'organised register of 
infinitely numerous experiences received during the evolution of life, or rather 
during the evolution of that series of organisms through which the human 
organism has been reached. The effects of the most uniform and frequent of these 
experiences have been successively bequeathed, principal and interest, and have 
slowly mounted to that high intelligence which lies latent in the brain of the 
infant. Thus it happens that the European inherits from twenty to thirty cubic 
inches more of brain than the Papuan. Thus it happens that faculties, as of 
music, which scarcely exist in some inferior races, become congenital in 
superior ones. Thus it happens that out of savages unable to count up to the 
number of their fingers, and speaking a language containing only nouns and 
verbs, arise at length our Newtons and Shakespeares.'
At the outset of this Address it was stated that physical theories which lie 
beyond experience are derived by a process of abstraction from experience. It is 
instructive to note from this point of view the successive introduction of new 
conceptions. The idea of the attrac-
[page 53]
tion of gravitation was preceded by the observation of the attraction of iron by 
a magnet, and of light bodies by rubbed amber. The polarity of magnetism and 
electricity appealed to the senses; and thus became the sub-stratum of the 
conception that atoms and molecules are endowed with definite, attractive, and 
repellent poles, by the play of which definite forms of crystalline architecture 
are produced. Thus molecular force becomes structural. It required no great 
boldness of thought to extend its play into organic nature, and to recognize in 
molecular force the agency by which both plants and animals are built up. In 
this way out of experience arise conceptions which are wholly 
ultra-experiential. None of the atomists of antiquity had any notion of this 
play of molecular polar force, but they had experience of gravity as manifested 
by falling bodies. Abstracting from this, they permitted their atoms to fall 
eternally through empty space. Democritus assumed that the larger atoms moved 
more rapidly than the smaller ones, which they therefore could overtake, and 
with which they could combine. Epicurus, holding that empty space could offer no 
resistance to motion, ascribed to all the atoms the same velocity; but he seems 
to have overlooked the consequence that under such circumstances the atoms could 
never combine. Lucretius cut the knot by quitting the domain of physics 
altogether, and causing the atoms to move together by a kind of volition.
Was the instinct utterly at fault which caused Lucretius thus to swerve from his 
own principles? Diminishing gradually the number of progenitors, Mr. Darwin 
comes at length to one 'primordial form;' but he does not say, as far as I 
remember, how he supposes this form to have been introduced. He quotes with 
satisfaction the words of  a celebrated author and divine who had 'gradually 
[page 54]
learnt to see that it is just as noble a conception of the Deity to believe He 
created a few original forms, capable of self-development into other and needful 
forms, as to believe that He required a fresh act of creation to supply the 
voids caused by the action of His laws.' What Mr. Darwin thinks of this view of 
the introduction of life I do not know. But the anthropomorphism, which it 
seemed his object to set aside, is as firmly associated with the creation of a 
few forms as with the creation of a multitude. We need clearness and 
thoroughness here. Two courses and two only, are possible. Either let us open 
our doors freely to the conception of creative acts, or, abandoning them, let us 
radically change our notions of Matter. If we look at matter as pictured by 
Democritus, and as defined for generations in our scientific text-books, the 
notion of any form of life whatever coming out of it is utterly unimaginable. 
The argument placed in the mouth of Bishop Butler suffices, in my opinion, to 
crush all such materialism as this. But those who framed these definitions of 
matter were not biologists, but mathematicians, whose labours referred only to 
such accidents and properties of matter as could be expressed in their formulae. 
The very intentness with which they pursued mechanical science turned their 
thoughts aside from the science of life. May not their imperfect definitions be 
the real cause of our present dread? Let us reverently, but honestly, look the 
question in the face. Divorced from matter, where is life to be found? Whatever 
our faith may say, our knowledge shows them to be indissolubly joined. Every 
meal we eat, and every cup we drink, illustrates the mysterious control of Mind 
by Matter.
Trace the line of life backwards, and see it approaching more and more to what 
we call the purely physical 
[page 55]
condition. We come at length to those organisms which I have compared to drops 
of oil suspended in a mixture of alcohol and water. We reach the protogenes of 
Haeckel, in which we have 'a type distinguishable from a fragment of albumen 
only by its finely granular character.' Can we pause here? We break a magnet and 
find two poles in each of its fragments. We continue the process of breaking, 
but, however small the parts, each carries with it, though enfeebled, the 
polarity of the whole. And when we can break no longer, we prolong the 
intellectual vision to the polar molecules. Are we not urged to do something 
similar in the case of life? Is there not a temptation to close to some extent 
with Lucretius, when he affirms that 'nature is seen to do all things 
spontaneously of herself without the meddling of the gods?' or with Bruno, when 
he declares that Matter is not 'that mere empty capacity which philosophers have 
pictured her to be, but the universal mother who wrings forth all things as the 
fruit of her own womb?' Believing as I do in the continuity of Nature, I cannot 
stop abruptly where our microscopes cease to be of use. Here the vision of the 
mind authoritatively supplements the vision of the eye. By an intellectual 
necessity I cross the boundary of the experimental evidence, and discern in that 
Matter which we, in our ignorance of its latent powers, and notwithstanding our 
professed reverence for its Creator, have hitherto covered with opprobrium, the 
promise and potency of all terrestrial Life.
If you ask me whether there exists the least evidence to prove that any form of 
life can be developed out of matter, without demonstrable antecedent life, my 
reply is that evidence considered perfectly conclusive by many has been adduced; 
and that were some of us who have pondered this question to follow a very common 
example, and 
[page 56]
accept testimony because it falls in with our belief, we also should eagerly 
close with the evidence referred to. But there is in the true man of science a 
wish stronger than the wish to have his beliefs upheld; namely, the wish to have 
them true. And this stronger wish causes him to reject the most plausible 
support if he has reason to suspect that it is vitiated by error. Those to whom 
I refer as having studied this question, believing the evidence offered in 
favour of 'spontaneous generation' to be thus vitiated, cannot accept it. They 
know full well that the chemist now prepares from inorganic matter a vast array 
of substances which were some time ago regarded as the sole products of 
vitality. They are intimately acquainted with the structural power of matter as 
evidenced in the phenomena of crystallization. They can justify scientifically 
their belief in its potency, under the proper conditions, to produce organisms. 
But in reply to your question they will frankly admit their inability to point 
to any satisfactory experimental proof that life can be developed save from 
demonstrable antecedent life. As already indicated, they draw the line from the 
highest organisms through lower ones down to the lowest, and it is the 
prolongation of this line by the intellect beyond the range of the senses that 
leads them to the conclusion which Bruno so boldly enunciated. 20
The 'materialism' here professed may be vastly different from what you suppose, 
and I therefore crave your gracious patience to the end. 'The question of an 
external world,' says Mr. J. S. Mill, 'is the great battleground of 
metaphysics.'21 Mr. Mill himself reduces external phenomena to 'possibilities of 
sensation.' Kant, as we have seen, made time and space 'forms' of our 
20. Bruno was a 'Pantheist,' not an 'Atheist' or a 'Materialist.'
21. Examination of Hamilton, p. 154. 
[page 57]
own intuitions. Fichte, having first by the inexorable logic of his 
understanding proved himself to be a mere link in that chain of eternal 
causation which holds so rigidly in Nature, violently broke the chain by making 
Nature, and all that it inherits, an apparition of his own mind. 22 And it is by 
no means easy to combat such notions. For when I say I see you, and that I have 
not the least doubt about it, the reply is, that what I am really conscious of 
is an affection of my own retina. And if I urge that I can check my sight of you 
by touching you, the retort would be that I am equally transgressing the limits 
of fact; for what I am really conscious of is, not that you are there, but that 
the nerves of my hand have undergone a change. All we hear, and see, and touch, 
and taste, and smell, are, it would be urged, mere variations of our own 
condition, beyond which, even to the extent of a hair's breadth, we cannot go. 
That anything answering to our impressions exists outside of ourselves is not a 
fact, but an inference, to which all validity would be denied by an idealist 
like Berkeley, or by a sceptic like Hume. Mr. Spencer takes another line. With 
him, as with the uneducated man, there is no doubt or question as to the 
existence of an external world. But he differs from the uneducated, who think 
that the world really is what consciousness represents it to be. Our states of 
consciousness are mere symbols of an outside entity which produces them and 
determines the order of their succession, but the real nature of which we can 
never know. 23 In fact, the whole process of evolution is the manifestation of a 
Power absolutely inscrutable 
22. Bestimmung des Menschen.
23. In a paper, at once popular and profound, entitled Recent Progress in the 
Theory of Vision, contained in the volume of Lectures by Helmholtz, published by 
Longmans, this symbolism of our 
[page 58]
to the intellect of man. As little in our day as in the days of Job can man by 
searching find this Power out. Considered fundamentally, then, it is by the 
operation of an insoluble mystery that life on earth is evolved, species 
differentiated, and mind unfolded from their prepotent elements in the 
immeasurable past. There is, you will observe, no very rank materialism here.
The strength of the doctrine of evolution consists, not in an experimental 
demonstration (for the subject is hardly accessible to this mode of proof), but 
in its general harmony with scientific thought. From contrast, moreover, it 
derives enormous relative strength. On the one side we have a theory (if it 
could with any propriety be so called) derived, as were the theories referred to 
at the beginning of this Address, not from the study of Nature, but from the 
observation of menóa theory which converts the Power whose garment is seen in the 
visible universe into an Artificer, fashioned after the human model, and acting 
by broken efforts, as man is seen to act. On the other side, we have the 
conception that all we see around us, and all we feel within usóthe phenomena of 
physical nature as well as those of the human mindóhave
[footnote 23 continued] states of consciousness is also dwelt upon. The 
impressions of sense are the mere signs of external things. In this paper 
Helmholtz contends strongly against the view that the consciousness of space is 
inborn; and he evidently doubts the power of the chick to pick up grains of corn 
without preliminary lessons. On this point, he says, further experiments are 
needed. Such experiments have been since made by Mr. Spalding, aided, I believe, 
in some of his observations by the accomplished and deeply lamented Lady 
Amberly; and they seem to prove conclusively that the chick does not need a 
single moment's tuition to enable it to stand, run, govern the muscles of its 
eyes, and to peck. Helmholtz, however, is contending against the notion of 
pre-established harmony; and I am not aware of his views as to the organisation 
of experiences of race or breed.
[page 59]
their unsearchable roots in a cosmical life, if I dare apply the term, an 
infinitesimal span of which is offered to the investigation of man. And even 
this span is only knowable in part. We can trace the development of a nervous 
system, and correlate with it the parallel phenomena of sensation and thought. 
We see with undoubting certainty that they go hand in hand. But we try to soar 
in a vacuum the moment we seek to comprehend the connexion between them. An 
Archimedean fulcrum is here required which the human mind cannot command; and 
the effort to solve the problem, to borrow a comparison from an illustrious 
friend of mine, is like the effort of a man trying to lift himself by his own 
waistband. All that has been here said is to be taken in connexion with this 
fundamental truth. When 'nascent senses' are spoken of, when 'the 
differentiation of a tissue at first vaguely sensitive all over' is spoken of, 
and when these processes are associated with 'the modification of an organism by 
its environment,' the same parallelism, without contact, or even approach to 
contact, is implied. Man the object is separated by an impassible gulf from man 
the subject. There is no motor energy in intellect to carry it without logical 
rupture from the one to the other.
Further, the doctrine of evolution derives man in his totality from the 
inter-action of organism and environment through countless ages past. The Human 
Understanding, for exampleóthat faculty which Mr. Spencer has turned so skilfully 
round upon its own antecedentsóis itself a result of the play between organism 
and environment through cosmic ranges of time. Never surely did prescription 
plead so irresistible a claim. But then it comes to pass that, over and above 
his understanding, 
[page 60]
there are many other things appertaining to man whose perspective rights are 
quite as strong as those of the understanding itself. It is a result, for 
example, of the play of organism and environment that sugar is sweet and that 
aloes are bitter, that the smell of henbane differs from the perfume of a rose. 
Such facts of consciousness (for which, by the way, no adequate reason has yet 
been rendered) are quite as old as the understanding; and many other things can 
boast an equally ancient origin. Mr. Spencer at one place refers to that most 
powerful of passionsóthe amatory passionóas one which, when it first occurs, is 
antecedent to all relative experience whatever; and we may pass its claim as 
being at least as ancient and valid as that of the understanding. Then there are 
such things woven into the texture of man as the feeling of Awe, Reverence, 
Wonderóand not alone the sexual love just referred to, but the love of the 
beautiful, physical, and moral, in Nature, Poetry, and Art. There is also that 
deep-set feeling which, since the earliest dawn of history, and probably for 
ages prior to all history, incorporated itself in the Religions of the world. 
You who have escaped from these religions into the high-and-dry light of the 
intellect may deride them; but in so doing you deride accidents of form merely, 
and fail to touch the immovable basis of the religious sentiment in the nature 
of man. To yield this sentiment reasonable satisfaction is the problem of 
problems at the present hour. And grotesque in relation to scientific culture as 
many of the religions of the world have been and areÅEdangerous, nay destructive, 
to the dearest privileges of freemen as some of them undoubtedly have been, and 
would, if they could, be againóit will be wise to recognize them as the forms of 
a force, mischievous, if permitted to 
[page 61]
intrude on the region of knowledge, over which it holds no command, but capable 
of being guided to noble issues in the region of emotion, which is its proper 
and elevated sphere.
All religious theories, schemes and systems, which embrace notions of cosmogony, 
or which otherwise reach into the domain of science, must, in so far as they do 
this, submit to the control of science, and relinquish all thought of 
controlling it.
Acting otherwise proved disastrous in the past, and it is simply fatuous to-day. 
Every system which would escape the fate of an organism too rigid to adjust 
itself to its environment must be plastic to the extent that the growth of 
knowledge demands. When this truth has been thoroughly 
[page 62]
taken in, rigidity will be relaxed, exclusiveness diminished, things now deemed 
essential will be dropped, and elements now rejected will be assimilated. The 
lifting of the life is the essential point; and as long as dogmatism, 
fanaticism, and intolerance are kept out, various modes of leverage may be 
employed to raise life to a higher level. Science itself not unfrequently 
derives motive power from an ultra-scientific source. Whewell speaks of 
enthusiasm of temper as a hindrance to science; but he means the enthusiasm of 
weak heads. There is a strong and resolute enthusiasm in which science finds an 
ally; and it is to the lowering of this fire, rather than to the diminution of 
intellectual insight, that the lessening productiveness of men of science in 
their mature years is to be ascribed. Mr. Buckle sought to detach intellectual 
achievement from moral force. He gravely erred; for without moral force to whip 
it into action, the achievements of the intellect would be poor indeed.
It has been said that science divorces itself from 
[page 63]
literature; but the statement, like so many others, arises from lack of 
knowledge. A glance at the less technical writings of its leadersóof its 
Helmholtz, its Huxley, and its Du Bois-Reymondówould show what breadth of 
literary culture they command. Where among modern writers can you find their 
superiors in clearness and vigour of literary style? Science desires not 
isolation, but freely combines with every effort towards the bettering of man's 
estate. Single-handed, and supported not by outward sympathy, but by inward 
force, it has built at least one great wing of the many-mansioned home which man 
in his totality demands. And if rough walls and protruding rafter-ends indicate 
that on one side the edifice is still incomplete, it is only by wise combination 
of the parts required with those already irrevocably built that we can hope for 
completeness. There is no necessary incongruity between what has been 
accomplished and what remains to be done. The moral glow of Socrates, which we 
all feel by ignition, has in it nothing incompatible with the physics of 
Anaxagoras which he so much scorned, but which he would hardly scorn to-day.
And here I am reminded of one amongst us, hoary, but still strong, whose 
prophet-voice some thirty years ago, far more than any other of this age, 
unlocked whatever of life and nobleness lay latent in its most gifted mindsóone 
fit to stand beside Socrates or the Maccabean Eleazar, and to dare and suffer 
all that they suffered and daredÅEfit, as he once said of Fichte, 'to have been 
the teacher of the Stoa, and to have discoursed of Beauty and Virtue in the 
groves of Academe.' With a capacity to grasp physical principles which his 
friend Goethe did not possess, and which even total lack of exercise has not 
been able to reduce to atrophy, it is the world's loss that he, in the vigour of 
his years, did not open his mind and sympathies 
[page 64]
to science, and make its conclusions a portion of his message to mankind. 
Marvellously endowed as he wasóequally equipped on the side of the Heart and of 
the Understandingóhe might have done much towards teaching us how to reconcile 
the claims of both, and to enable them in coming times to dwell together in 
unity of spirit and in the bond of peace.
And now the end is come. With more time, or greater strength and knowledge, what 
has been here said might have been better said, while worthy matters here 
omitted might have received fit expression. But there would have been no 
material deviation from the views set forth. As regards myself, they are not the 
growth of a day; and as regards you, I thought you ought to know the environment 
which, with or without your consent, is rapidly surrounding you, and in relation 
to which some adjustment on your part may be necessary. A hint of Hamlet's, 
however, teaches us all how the troubles of common life may be ended; and it is 
perfectly possible for you and me to purchase intellectual peace at the price of 
intellectual death. The world is not without refuges of this description; nor is 
it wanting in persons who seek their shelter and try to persuade others to do 
the same. The unstable and the weak will yield to this persuasion, and they to 
whom repose is sweeter than the truth. But I would exhort you to refuse the 
offered shelter and to scorn the base reposeóto accept, if the choice be forced 
upon you, commotion before stagnation, the leap of the torrent before the 
stillness of the swamp.
In the course of this Address I have touched on debatable questions and led you 
over what will be deemed dangerous groundóand this partly with the view of 
telling you that as regards these questions science claims unrestricted right of 
search. It is not to the point to say that the 
[page 65]
views of Lucretius and Bruno, of Darwin and Spencer, may be wrong. Here I should 
agree with you, deeming it indeed certain that these views will undergo 
modification. But the point is, that, whether right or wrong, we ask the freedom 
to discuss them. For science, however, no exclusive claim is here made; you are 
not urged to erect it into an idol. The inexorable advance of man's 
understanding in the path of knowledge, and those unquenchable claims of his 
moral and emotional nature which the understanding can never satisfy, are here 
equally set forth. The world embraces not only a Newton, but a Shakespeareónot 
only a Boyle, but a Raphaelónot only a Kant, but a Beethovenónot only a Darwin, 
but a Carlyle. Not in each of these, but in all, is human nature whole. They are 
not opposed, but supplementaryónot mutually exclusive, but reconcilable. And if, 
unsatisfied with them all, the human mind, with the yearning of a pilgrim for 
his distant home, will turn to the Mystery from which it has emerged, seeking so 
to fashion it as to give unity to thought and faith; so long as this is done, 
not only without intolerance or bigotry of any kind, but with the enlightened 
recognition that ultimate fixity of conception is here unattainable, and that 
each succeeding age must be held free to fashion the Mystery in accordance with 
its own needsóthen, casting aside all the restrictions of Materialism, I would 
affirm this to be a field for the noblest exercise of what, in contrast with the 
knowing faculties, may be called the creative faculties of man.
'Fill thy heart with it,' said Goethe, 'and then name it as thou wilt.' Goethe 
himself did this in untranslateable language.24 Wordsworth did it in words known 
to all Englishmen,

and which may be regarded as a forecast and religious vitalization of the latest 
and deepest scientific truth,ÅE/p> 
'For I have learned
To look on nature; not as in the hour
Of thoughtless youth; but hearing oftentimes
The still, sad music of humanity,
Nor harsh nor grating, though of ample power
To chasten and subdue. And I have felt
A presence that disturbs me with the joy
Of elevated thoughts; a sense sublime
Of something far more deeply interfused,
Whose dwelling is the light of setting suns,
And the round ocean, and the living air,
And the blue sky, and in the mind of man:
A motion and a spirit, that impels
All thinking things, all objects of all thought,
And rolls through all things.'25
