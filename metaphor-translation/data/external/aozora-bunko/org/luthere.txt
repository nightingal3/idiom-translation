       Q. What does this mean?

       A. We must fear and love God, so that we will neither look down
       on our parents or superiors nor irritate them, but will honor
       them, serve them, obey them, love them and value them.

       E.    The Fifth Commandment

       Q. What does this mean?

       You must not commit adultery.

       Q. What does this mean?

       K.    The Conclusion to the Commandments

       Q. What does God say to us about all these commandments?

       A. This is what He says:

       ``I am the Lord Your God. I am a jealous God. I plague the
       grandchildren and great-grandchildren of those who hate me with
       their ancestor's sin. But I make whole those who love me for a
       thousand generations.''

       Q. What does it mean?

       A. God threatens to punish everyone who breaks these commandments.
       We should be afraid of His anger because of this and not violate
       such commandments. But He promises grace and all good things to
       those who keep such commandments. Because of this, we, too, should
       love Him, trust Him, and willingly do what His commandments
       require.

                               Part Two: The Creed
                         Translated by Robert E. Smith
                                  May 22, 1994

       The Creed: The Simple Way a Father Should Present it to His Household

       I.  The First Article: On Creation

       I believe in God the Almighty Father, Creator of Heaven and Earth.

       Q. What does this mean?

       A. I believe that God created me, along with all creatures. He gave to
          me: body and soul, eyes, ears and all the other parts of my body,
          my mind and all my senses and preserves them as well. He gives me
          clothing and shoes, food and drink, house and land, wife and
          children, fields, animals and all I own. Every day He abundantly
          provides everything I need to nourish this body and life. He
          protects me against all danger, shields and defends me from all
          evil.  He does all this because of His pure, fatherly and divine
          goodness and His mercy, not because I've earned it or desrved it.
          For all of this, I must thank Him, praise Him, serve Him and obey
          Him.  Yes, this is true!

       II. The Second Article: On Redemption

       And in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord, Who was conceived by the
       Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate,
       was crucified, died and was buried, descended to Hell, on the third
       day rose again from the dead, ascended to Heaven and sat down at the
       right hand of God the Almighty Father. From there He will come to
       judge the living and the dead.

       Q. What does this mean?
       A. I believe that Jesus Christ is truly God, born of the Father in
          eternity and also truly man, born of the Virgin Mary. He is my
          Lord! He redeemed me, a lost and condemned person, bought and won
          me from all sins, death and the authority of the Devil. It did not
          cost Him gold or silver, but His holy, precious blood, His innocent
          body -- His death! Because of this, I am His very own, will live
          under Him in His kingdom and serve Him righteously, innocently and
          blessedly forever, just as He is risen from death, lives and reigns
          forever. Yes, this is true.

       III. The Third Article: On Becoming Holy

       I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy Christian Church, the community
       of the saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body,
       and an everlasting life. Amen.

       Q. What does this mean?
       A. I believe that I cannot come to my Lord Jesus Christ by my own
       intellegence or power. But the Holy Spirit call me by the Gospel,
       enlightened me with His gifts, made me holy and kept me in the true
       faith, just as He calls, gathers together, enlightens and makes holy
       the whole Church on earth and keeps it with Jesus in the one, true
       faith. In this Church, He generously forgives each day every sin
       committed by me and by every believer.  On the last day, He will raise
       me and all the dead from the grave. He will give eternal life to me
       and to all who believe in Christ. Yes, this is true!

                        Part Three: The Lord's Prayer
                        Translated by Robert E. Smith
                                June 10, 1994


                               The Our Father
         The Simple Way a Father Should Present it to His Household

I.     Introduction
       Our Father, Who is in Heaven.

       Q. What does this mean?

       A. In this introduction, God invites us to believe that He is our real
          Father and we are His real children, so that we will pray with
          trust and complete confidence, in the same way beloved children
          approach their beloved Father with their requests.

II.    The First Request
       May Your name be holy.

       Q. What does this mean?

       A. Of course, God's name is holy in and of itself, but by this
          request, we pray that He will make it holy among us, too.

       Q. How does this take place?
       A. When God's Word is taught clearly and purely, and when we live holy
          lives as God's children based upon it.  Help us, Heavenly Father,
          to do this! But anyone who teaches and lives by something other
          than God's Word defiles God's name among us. Protect us from this,
          Heavenly Father!

III.   The Second Request
       Your Kingdom come.

       Q. What does this mean?

       A. Truly God's Kingdom comes by itself, without our prayer. But we
          pray in this request that it come to us as well.

       Q. How does this happen?
       A. When the Heavenly Father gives us His Holy Spirit, so that we
          believe His holy Word by His grace and live godly lives here in
          this age and there in eternal life.

IV.    The Third Request
       May Your will be accomplished, as it is Heaven, so may it be on Earth.

       Q. What does this mean?
       A. Truly, God's good and gracious will is accomplished without our
          prayer. But we pray in this request that is be accomplished among
          us as well.

       Q. How does this happen?
       A. When God destroys and interferes with every evil will and all evil
          advice, which will not allow God's Kingdom to come, such as the
          Devil's will, the world's will and will of our bodily desires. It
          also happens when God strengthens us by faith and by His Word and
          keeps living by them faithfully until the end of our lives.  This
          is His will, good and full of grace.

V.     The Fourth Request
       Give us our daily bread today.

       Q. What does this mean?
       A. Truly, God gives daily bread to evil people, even without our
          prayer. But we pray in this request that He will help us realize
          this and receive our daily bread with thanksgiving.

       Q. What does ``Daily Bread'' mean?
       A. Everything that nourishes our body and meets its needs, such as:
          Food, drink, clothing, shoes, house, yard, fields, cattle, money,
          possessions, a devout spouse, devout children, devout employees,
          devout and faithful rulers, good government, good weather, peace,
          health, discipline, honor, good friends, faithful neighbors and
          other things like these.

VI.    The Fifth Request
       And forgive our guilt, as we forgive those guilty of sinning against
       us.

       Q. What does this mean?
       A. We pray in this request that our Heavenly Father will neither pay
       attention to our sins nor refuse requests such as these because of our
       sins and because we are neither worthy nor deserve the things for
       which we pray. Yet He wants to give them all to us by His grace,
       because many times each day we sin and truly deserve only punishment.
       Because God does this, we will, of course, want to forgive from our
       hearts and willingly do good to those who sin against us.

VII.   The Sixth Request
       And lead us not into temptation.

       Q. What does this mean?
       A. God tempts no one, of course, but we pray in this request that God
          will protect us and save us, so that the Devil, the world and our
          bodily desires will neither deceive us nor seduce us into heresy,
          despair or other serious shame or vice, and so that we will win and
          be victorious in the end, even if they attack us.

VIII.     The Seventh Request
          But set us free from the Evil One.

       Q. What does this mean?
       A. We pray in this request, as a summary, that our Father in Heaven
          will save us from every kind of evil that threatens body, soul,
          property and honor. We pray that when at last our final hour has
          come, He will grant us a blessed death, and, in His grace, bring us
          to Himself from this valley of tears.

IX.       Amen.
       Q. What does this mean?
       A. That I should be certain that such prayers are acceptable to the
          Father in Heaven and will be granted, that He Himself has commanded
          us to pray in this way and that He promises to answer us. Amen.
          Amen. This means: Yes, yes it will happen this way.

       A. That I should be certain that such prayers are acceptable to the
          Father in Heaven and will be granted, that He Himself has commanded
          us to pray in this way and that He promises to answer us. Amen.
          Amen. This means: Yes, yes it will happen this way.

                            Part Five: Confession
                        Translated by Robert E. Smith
                                June 10, 1994

               How One Should Teach the Uneducated to Confess

       I.   Q.   What is confession?
            A.   Confession has two parts:

                 First, a person admits his sin

                 Second, a person receives absolution or forgiveness from the
                 confessor, as if from God Himself, without doubting it, but
                 believing firmly that his sins are forgiven by God in Heaven
                 through it.

       II.  Q. Which sins should people confess?

            A. When speaking to God, we should plead guilty to all sins, even
               those we don't know about, just as we do in the ``Our
               Father,'' but when speaking to the confessor, only the sins we
               know about, which we know about and feel in our hearts.

            Q. Which are these?

            A. Consider here your place in life according to the Ten
               Commandments.  Are you a father?  A mother? A son? A daughter?
               A husband? A wife? A servant? Are you disobedient, unfaithful
               or lazy? Have you hurt anyone with your words or actions? Have
               you stolen, neglected your duty, let things go or injured
               someone?

                      Luther's Little Instruction Book
                   (The Small Catechism of Martin Luther)
                    Part Six: The Sacrament of the Altar
                        Translated by Robert E. Smith
                                June 10, 1994

                         The Sacrament of the Altar:
         The Simple Way a Father Should Present it to his Household

       I.   Q. What is the Sacrament of the Altar?

            A. It is the true body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ under
               bread and wine for us Christians to eat and to drink,
               established by Christ Himself.

       II.  Q. Where is that written?

            A. The holy apostles Matthew, Mark and Luke and St. Paul
               write this:

               ``Our Lord Jesus Christ, in the night on which He was
                 betrayed, took bread, gave thanks, broke it, gave it to His
                 disciples and said: ``Take! Eat! This is My body, which is
                 given for you. Do this to remember Me!'' In the same way He
                 also took the cup after supper, gave thanks, gave it to
                 them, and said: ``Take and drink from it, all of you! This
                 cup is the New Testament in my blood, which is shed for you
                 to forgive sins. This do, as often as you drink it, to
                 remember Me!''

       III. Q. What good does this eating and drinking do?

            A. These words tell us: ``Given for you'' and ``Shed for you to
               forgive sins.'' Namely, that the forgiveness of sins, life and
               salvation are given to us through these words in the
               sacrament. Because, where sins are forgiven, there is life and
               salvation as well.

       IV.  Q. How can physical eating and drinking do such great things?

            A. Of course, eating and drinking do not do these things. These
               words, written here, do them: ``given for you'' and ``shed for
               you to forgive sins.'' These words, along with physical eating
               and drinking are the important part of the sacrament. Anyone
               who believes these words has what they say and what they
               record, namely, the forgiveness of sins.

       V.   Q. Who, then, receives such a sacrament in a worthy way?

            A. Of course, fasting and other physical preparations are
               excellent disciplines for the body. But anyone who believes
               these words, ``Given for you,'' and ``Shed for you to forgive
               sins,'' is really worthy and well prepared.  But whoever
               doubts or does not believe these words is not worthy and is
               unprepared, because the words, ``for you'' demand a heart that
               fully believes.

                             Appendix 1: Devotions
                         Translated by Robert E. Smith
                                 July 11, 1994


                    How a Father Should Teach His Household
                   to Conduct Morning and Evening Devotions.


                               Morning Devotions

       As soon as you get out of bed in the morning, you should bless
       yourself with the sign of the Holy Cross and say:


       May the will of God, the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit be
       done! Amen.


       Then, kneeling or standing, say the creed and pray the Lord's
       Prayer. If you wish, you may then pray this little prayer as well:


       My Heavenly Father, I thank You, through Jesus Christ, Your
       beloved Son, that You kept me safe from all evil and danger last
       night. Save me, I pray, today as well, from every evil and sin, so
       that all I do and the way that I live will please you. I put
       myself in your care, body and soul and all that I have. Let Your
       holy Angels be with me, so that the evil enemy will not gain power
       over me. Amen.

       After that, with joy go about your work and perhaps sing a song
       inspired by the Ten Commandments or your own thoughts.



                             The Evening Devotions

       When you go to bed in the evening, you should bless yourself with
       the sign of the Holy Cross and say:

       May the will of God, the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit be
       done! Amen.

       Then, kneeling or standing, say the creed and pray the Lord's
       Prayer. If you wish, then you may pray this little prayer as well:


       My Heavenly Father, I thank You, through Jesus Christ, Your
       beloved Son, that You have protected me, by Your grace. Forgive, I
       pray, all my sins and the evil I have done. Protect me, by Your
       grace, tonight. I put myself in your care, body and soul and all
       that I have. Let Your holy angels be with me, so that the evil
       enemy will not gain power over me. Amen.

       After this, go to sleep immediately with joy.


                    How a Father Should Teach His Household
                   to say Grace and Return Thanks at Meals:

       The children and servants should come to the table modestly and
       with folded hands and say:

       All eyes look to you, O Lord, and You give everyone food at the
       right time. You open Your generous hands and satisfy the hunger of
       all living things with what they desire.

       Note:

       "What they desire" means that all animals get so much to eat, that
       they are happy and cheerful. Because, worry and greed interferes
       with such desires.

       After this, pray the Lord's Prayer and the following prayer:

       Lord God, Heavenly Father, bless us and these gifts, which we
       receive from Your generous hand, through Jesus Christ, our Lord.
       Amen.
