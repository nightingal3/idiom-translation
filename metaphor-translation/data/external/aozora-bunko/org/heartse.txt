Project Gutenberg Etexts are usually created from multiple editions,
all of which are in the Public Domain in the United States, unless a
copyright notice is included.  Therefore, we usually do NOT keep any
of these books in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our books one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to send us error messages even years after
the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our sites at:
http://gutenberg.net
http://promo.net/pg


Those of you who want to download any Etext before announcement
can surf to them as follows, and just download by date; this is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext03
or
ftp://ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext03

Or /etext02, 01, 00, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90

Just search by the first five letters of the filename you want,
as it appears in our Newsletters.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release fifty new Etext
files per month, or 500 more Etexts in 2000 for a total of 3000+
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
should reach over 300 billion Etexts given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000 = 1 Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

At our revised rates of production, we will reach only one-third
of that goal by the end of 2001, or about 4,000 Etexts unless we
manage to get some real funding.

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has been created
to secure a future for Project Gutenberg into the next millennium.

**The Legal Small Print**


(Three Pages)

***START**THE SMALL PRINT!**FOR PUBLIC DOMAIN ETEXTS**START***
Why is this "Small Print!" statement here?  You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
you may distribute copies of this etext if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement.  If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from.  If you received this etext on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etexts,
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market
any commercial products without permission.

To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] Michael Hart and the Foundation (and any other party you may
receive this etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims
all liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from.  If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy.  If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS ETEXT IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS".  NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE ETEXT OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold Michael Hart, the Foundation,
and its trustees and agents, and any volunteers associated
with the production and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
texts harmless, from all liability, cost and expense, including
legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of the
following that you do or cause:  [1] distribution of this etext,
[2] alteration, modification, or addition to the etext,
or [3] any Defect.

DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"

     requires that you do not remove, alter or modify the
     etext or this "small print!" statement.  You may however,
     if you wish, distribute this etext in machine readable
     binary, compressed, mark-up, or proprietary form,

     [*]  The etext, when displayed, is clearly readable, and
          does *not* contain characters other than those
          intended by the author of the work, although tilde
          (~), asterisk (*) and underline (_) characters may
          be used to convey punctuation intended by the
          author, and additional characters may be used to
          indicate hypertext links; OR

     [*]  The etext may be readily converted by the reader at
          no expense into plain ASCII, EBCDIC or equivalent

     legally required to prepare) your annual (or equivalent
     periodic) tax return.  Please contact us beforehand to
     let us know your plans and to work out the details.

HEARTS AND HANDS

At Denver there was an influx of passengers into the coaches on the
eastbound B. & M. express.  In one coach there sat a very pretty young
woman dressed in elegant taste and surrounded by all the luxurious
comforts of an experienced traveler.  Among the newcomers were two
young men, one of handsome presence with a bold, frank countenance
and manner; the other a ruffled, glum-faced person, heavily built and
roughly dressed.  The two were handcuffed together.

As they passed down the aisle of the coach the only vacant seat
offered was a reversed one facing the attractive young woman.  Here
the linked couple seated themselves.  The young woman's glance fell
upon them with a distant, swift disinterest; then with a lovely smile
brightening her countenance and a tender pink tingeing her rounded
cheeks, she held out a little gray-gloved hand.  When she spoke her
voice, full, sweet, and deliberate, proclaimed that its owner was
accustomed to speak and be heard.

"Well, Mr. Easton, if you ~will~ make me speak first, I suppose I
must.  Don't vou ever recognize old friends when you meet them in
the West?"

The younger man roused himself sharply at the sound of her voice,
seemed to struggle with a slight embarrassment which he threw off
instantly, and then clasped her fingers with his left hand.

"It's Miss Fairchild," he said, with a smile.  "I'll ask you to excuse
the other hand; "it's otherwise engaged just at present."

He slightly raised his right hand, bound at the wrist by the shining
"bracelet" to the left one of his companion.  The glad look in the
girl's eyes slowly changed to a bewildered horror.  The glow faded
from her cheeks.  Her lips parted in a vague, relaxing distress.
Easton, with a little laugh, as if amused, was about to speak again
when the other forestalled him.  The glum-faced man had been watching
the girl's countenance with veiled glances from his keen, shrewd eyes.

"You'll excuse me for speaking, miss, but, I see you're acquainted
with the marshall here.  If you'll ask him to speak a word for me when
we get to the pen he'll do it, and it'll make things easier for me
there.  He's taking me to Leavenworth prison.  It's seven years for
counterfeiting."

"Oh!" said the girl, with a deep breath and returning color.  "So that
is what you are doing out here?  A marshal!"

"My dear Miss Fairchild," said Easton, calmly, "I had to do something.
Money has a way of taking wings unto itself, and you know it takes
money to keep step with our crowd in Washington.  I saw this opening
in the West, and--well, a marshalship isn't quite as high a position
as that of ambassador, but--"

"The ambassador," said the girl, warmly, "doesn't call any more.  He
needn't ever have done so.  You ought to know that.  And so now you
are one of these dashing Western heroes, and you ride and shoot and go
into all kinds of dangers.  That's different from the Washington life.
You have been missed from the old crowd."

The girl's eyes, fascinated, went back, widening a little, to rest
upon the glittering handcuffs.

"Don't you worry about them, miss," said the other man.  "All marshals
handcuff themselves to their prisoners to keep them from getting away.
Mr. Easton knows his business."

"Will we see you again soon in Washington?" asked the girl.

"Not soon, I think," said Easton.  "My butterfly days are over, I
fear."

"I love the West," said the girl irrelevantly.  Her eyes were
shining softly.  She looked away out the car window.  She began to
speak truly and simply without the gloss of style and manner:
"Mamma and I spent the summer in Denver.  She went home a week ago
because father was slightly ill.  I could live and be happy in the
West.  I think the air here agrees with me.  Money isn't everything.
But people always misunderstand things and remain stupid--"

"Say, Mr. Marshal," growled the glum-faced man.  "This isn't quite
fair.  I'm needing a drink, and haven't had a smoke all day.  Haven't
you talked long enough?  Take me in the smoker now, won't you?  I'm
half dead for a pipe."

The bound travelers rose to their feet, Easton with the same slow
smile on his face.

"I can't deny a petition for tobacco," he said, lightly.  "It's the
one friend of the unfortunate.  Good-bye, Miss Fairchild.  Duty calls,
you know."  He held out his hand for a farewell.

"It's too bad you are not going East," she said, reclothing herself
with manner and style.  "But you must go on to Leavenworth, I
suppose?"

"Yes," said Easton, "I must go on to Leavenworth."

The two men sidled down the aisle into the smoker.

The two passengers in a seat near by had heard most of the
conversation.  Said one of them:  "That marshal's a good sort of
chap.  Some of these Western fellows are all right."

"Pretty young to hold an office like that, isn't he?" asked the
other.

"Young!" exclaimed the first speaker, "why--Oh! didn't you catch on?
Say--did you ever know an officer to handcuff a prisoner to his
~right~ hand?"
