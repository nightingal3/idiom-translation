Chapter 1
In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that IÅfve 
been turning over in my mind ever since.
ÅgWhenever you feel like criticizing any one,Åh he told me, Ågjust remember that 
all the people in this world havenÅft had the advantages that youÅfve had.Åh
He didnÅft say any more, but weÅfve always been unusually communicative in a 
reserved way, and I understood that he meant a great deal more than that. In 
consequence, IÅfm inclined to reserve all judgments, a habit that has opened up 
many curious natures to me and also made me the victim of not a few veteran 
bores. The abnormal mind is quick to detect and attach itself to this quality 
when it appears in a normal person, and so it came about that in college I was 
unjustly accused of being a politician, because I was privy to the secret griefs 
of wild, unknown men. Most of the confidences were unsought&#8212;frequently I have 
feigned sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile levity when I realized by some 
unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quivering on the horizon; for 
the intimate revelations of young men, or at least the terms in which they 
express them, are usually plagiaristic and marred by obvious suppressions. 
Reserving judgments is a matter of infinite hope. I am still a little afraid of 
missing something if I forget that, as my father snobbishly suggested, and I 
snobbishly repeat, a sense of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out 
unequally at birth.
And, after boasting this way of my tolerance, I come to the admission that it 
has a limit. Conduct may be founded on the hard rock or the wet marshes, but 
after a certain point I donÅft care what itÅfs founded on. When I came back from 
the East last autumn I felt that I wanted the world to be in uniform and at a 
sort of moral attention forever; I wanted no more riotous excursions with 
privileged glimpses into the human heart. Only Gatsby, the man who gives his 
name to this book, was exempt from my reaction&#8212;Gatsby, who represented 
everything for which I have an unaffected scorn. If personality is an unbroken 
series of successful gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him, some 
heightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if he were related to one of 
those intricate machines that register earthquakes ten thousand miles away. This 
responsiveness had nothing to do with that flabby impressionability which is 
dignified under the name of the Ågcreative temperament.Åh&#8212;it was an extraordinary 
gift for hope, a romantic readiness such as I have never found in any other 
person and which it is not likely I shall ever find again. No&#8212;Gatsby turned out 
all right at the end; it is what preyed on Gatsby, what foul dust floated in the 
wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my interest in the abortive 
sorrows and short-winded elations of men.
My family have been prominent, well-to-do people in this Middle Western city for 
three generations. The Carraways are something of a clan, and we have a 
tradition that weÅfre descended from the Dukes of Buccleuch, but the actual 
founder of my line was my grandfatherÅfs brother, who came here in fifty-one, 
sent a substitute to the Civil War, and started the wholesale hardware business 
that my father carries on to-day.
I never saw this great-uncle, but IÅfm supposed to look like him&#8212;with special 
reference to the rather hard-boiled painting that hangs in fatherÅfs office I 
graduated from New Haven in 1915, just a quarter of a century after my father, 
and a little later I participated in that delayed Teutonic migration known as 
the Great War. I enjoyed the counter-raid so thoroughly that I came back 
restless. Instead of being the warm centre of the world, the Middle West now 
seemed like the ragged edge of the universe&#8212;so I decided to go East and learn 
the bond business. Everybody I knew was in the bond business, so I supposed it 
could support one more single man. All my aunts and uncles talked it over as if 
they were choosing a prep school for me, and finally said, ÅgWhy&#8212;ye&#8212;es,Åh with 
very grave, hesitant faces. Father agreed to finance me for a year, and after 
various delays I came East, permanently, I thought, in the spring of twenty-two.
The practical thing was to find rooms in the city, but it was a warm season, and 
I had just left a country of wide lawns and friendly trees, so when a young man 
at the office suggested that we take a house together in a commuting town, it 
sounded like a great idea. He found the house, a weather-beaten cardboard 
bungalow at eighty a month, but at the last minute the firm ordered him to 
Washington, and I went out to the country alone. I had a dog&#8212;at least I had him 
for a few days until he ran away&#8212;and an old Dodge and a Finnish woman, who made 
my bed and cooked breakfast and muttered Finnish wisdom to herself over the 
electric stove.
It was lonely for a day or so until one morning some man, more recently arrived 
than I, stopped me on the road.
ÅgHow do you get to West Egg village?Åh he asked helplessly.
I told him. And as I walked on I was lonely no longer. I was a guide, a 
pathfinder, an original settler. He had casually conferred on me the freedom of 
the neighborhood.
And so with the sunshine and the great bursts of leaves growing on the trees, 
just as things grow in fast movies, I had that familiar conviction that life was 
beginning over again with the summer.
There was so much to read, for one thing, and so much fine health to be pulled 
down out of the young breath-giving air. I bought a dozen volumes on banking and 
credit and investment securities, and they stood on my shelf in red and gold 
like new money from the mint, promising to unfold the shining secrets that only 
Midas and Morgan and Maecenas knew. And I had the high intention of reading many 
other books besides. I was rather literary in college&#8212;one year I wrote a series 
of very solemn and obvious editorials for the ÅgYale News.Åh&#8212;and now I was going 
to bring back all such things into my life and become again that most limited of 
all specialists, the Ågwell-rounded man.Åh This isnÅft just an epigram&#8212;life is much 
more successfully looked at from a single window, after all.
It was a matter of chance that I should have rented a house in one of the 
strangest communities in North America. It was on that slender riotous island 
which extends itself due east of New York&#8212;and where there are, among other 
natural curiosities, two unusual formations of land. Twenty miles from the city 
a pair of enormous eggs, identical in contour and separated only by a courtesy 
bay, jut out into the most domesticated body of salt water in the Western 
hemisphere, the great wet barnyard of Long Island Sound. they are not perfect 
ovals&#8212;like the egg in the Columbus story, they are both crushed flat at the 
contact end&#8212;but their physical resemblance must be a source of perpetual 
confusion to the gulls that fly overhead. to the wingless a more arresting 
phenomenon is their dissimilarity in every particular except shape and size.
I lived at West Egg, the&#8212;well, the less fashionable of the two, though this is a 
most superficial tag to express the bizarre and not a little sinister contrast 
between them. my house was at the very tip of the egg, only fifty yards from the 
Sound, and squeezed between two huge places that rented for twelve or fifteen 
thousand a season. the one on my right was a colossal affair by any standard&#8212;it 
was a factual imitation of some Hotel de Ville in Normandy, with a tower on one 
side, spanking new under a thin beard of raw ivy, and a marble swimming pool, 
and more than forty acres of lawn and garden. it was GatsbyÅfs mansion. Or, 
rather, as I didnÅft know Mr. Gatsby, it was a mansion inhabited by a gentleman 
of that name. My own house was an eyesore, but it was a small eyesore, and it 
had been overlooked, so I had a view of the water, a partial view of my 
neighborÅfs lawn, and the consoling proximity of millionaires&#8212;all for eighty 
dollars a month.
Across the courtesy bay the white palaces of fashionable East Egg glittered 
along the water, and the history of the summer really begins on the evening I 
drove over there to have dinner with the Tom Buchanans. Daisy was my second 
cousin once removed, and IÅfd known Tom in college. And just after the war I 
spent two days with them in Chicago.
Her husband, among various physical accomplishments, had been one of the most 
powerful ends that ever played football at New Haven&#8212;a national figure in a way, 
one of those men who reach such an acute limited excellence at twenty-one that 
everything afterward savors of anti-climax. His family were enormously 
wealthy&#8212;even in college his freedom with money was a matter for reproach&#8212;but now 
heÅfd left Chicago and come East in a fashion that rather took your breath away: 
for instance, heÅfd brought down a string of polo ponies from Lake Forest. it was 
hard to realize that a man in my own generation was wealthy enough to do that.
Why they came East I donÅft know. They had spent a year in France for no 
particular reason, and then drifted here and there unrestfully wherever people 
played polo and were rich together. This was a permanent move, said Daisy over 
the telephone, but I didnÅft believe it&#8212;I had no sight into DaisyÅfs heart, but I 
felt that Tom would drift on forever seeking, a little wistfully, for the 
dramatic turbulence of some irrecoverable football game.
And so it happened that on a warm windy evening I drove over to East Egg to see 
two old friends whom I scarcely knew at all. Their house was even more elaborate 
than I expected, a cheerful red-and-white Georgian Colonial mansion, overlooking 
the bay. The lawn started at the beach and ran toward the front door for a 
quarter of a mile, jumping over sun-dials and brick walks and burning 
gardens&#8212;finally when it reached the house drifting up the side in bright vines 
as though from the momentum of its run. The front was broken by a line of French 
windows, glowing now with reflected gold and wide open to the warm windy 
afternoon, and Tom Buchanan in riding clothes was standing with his legs apart 
on the front porch.
He had changed since his New Haven years. Now he was a sturdy straw-haired man 
of thirty with a rather hard mouth and a supercilious manner. Two shining 
arrogant eyes had established dominance over his face and gave him the 
appearance of always leaning aggressively forward. Not even the effeminate swank 
of his riding clothes could hide the enormous power of that body&#8212;he seemed to 
fill those glistening boots until he strained the top lacing, and you could see 
a great pack of muscle shifting when his shoulder moved under his thin coat. It 
was a body capable of enormous leverage&#8212;a cruel body.
His speaking voice, a gruff husky tenor, added to the impression of 
fractiousness he conveyed. There was a touch of paternal contempt in it, even 
toward people he liked&#8212;and there were men at New Haven who had hated his guts.
ÅgNow, donÅft think my opinion on these matters is final,Åh he seemed to say, Ågjust 
because IÅfm stronger and more of a man than you are.Åh We were in the same senior 
society, and while we were never intimate I always had the impression that he 
approved of me and wanted me to like him with some harsh, defiant wistfulness of 
his own.
We talked for a few minutes on the sunny porch.
ÅgIÅfve got a nice place here,Åh he said, his eyes flashing about restlessly.
Turning me around by one arm, he moved a broad flat hand along the front vista, 
including in its sweep a sunken Italian garden, a half acre of deep, pungent 
roses, and a snub-nosed motor-boat that bumped the tide offshore.
ÅgIt belonged to Demaine, the oil man.Åh He turned me around again, politely and 
abruptly. ÅgWeÅfll go inside.Åh
We walked through a high hallway into a bright rosy-colored space, fragilely 
bound into the house by French windows at either end. The windows were ajar and 
gleaming white against the fresh grass outside that seemed to grow a little way 
into the house. A breeze blew through the room, blew curtains in at one end and 
out the other like pale flags, twisting them up toward the frosted wedding-cake 
of the ceiling, and then rippled over the wine-colored rug, making a shadow on 
it as wind does on the sea.
The only completely stationary object in the room was an enormous couch on which 
two young women were buoyed up as though upon an anchored balloon. They were 
both in white, and their dresses were rippling and fluttering as if they had 
just been blown back in after a short flight around the house. I must have stood 
for a few moments listening to the whip and snap of the curtains and the groan 
of a picture on the wall. Then there was a boom as Tom Buchanan shut the rear 
windows and the caught wind died out about the room, and the curtains and the 
rugs and the two young women ballooned slowly to the floor.
The younger of the two was a stranger to me. She was extended full length at her 
end of the divan, completely motionless, and with her chin raised a little, as 
if she were balancing something on it which was quite likely to fall. If she saw 
me out of the corner of her eyes she gave no hint of it&#8212;indeed, I was almost 
surprised into murmuring an apology for having disturbed her by coming in.
The other girl, Daisy, made an attempt to rise&#8212;she leaned slightly forward with 
a conscientious expression&#8212;then she laughed, an absurd, charming little laugh, 
and I laughed too and came forward into the room.
ÅgIÅfm p-paralyzed with happiness.Åh She laughed again, as if she said something 
very witty, and held my hand for a moment, looking up into my face, promising 
that there was no one in the world she so much wanted to see. That was a way she 
had. She hinted in a murmur that the surname of the balancing girl was Baker. 
(IÅfve heard it said that DaisyÅfs murmur was only to make people lean toward her; 
an irrelevant criticism that made it no less charming.)
At any rate, Miss BakerÅfs lips fluttered, she nodded at me almost imperceptibly, 
and then quickly tipped her head back again&#8212;the object she was balancing had 
obviously tottered a little and given her something of a fright. Again a sort of 
apology arose to my lips. Almost any exhibition of complete self-sufficiency 
draws a stunned tribute from me.
I looked back at my cousin, who began to ask me questions in her low, thrilling 
voice. It was the kind of voice that the ear follows up and down, as if each 
speech is an arrangement of notes that will never be played again. Her face was 
sad and lovely with bright things in it, bright eyes and a bright passionate 
mouth, but there was an excitement in her voice that men who had cared for her 
found difficult to forget: a singing compulsion, a whispered ÅgListen,Åh a promise 
that she had done gay, exciting things just a while since and that there were 
gay, exciting things hovering in the next hour.
I told her how I had stopped off in Chicago for a day on my way East, and how a 
dozen people had sent their love through me.
ÅgDo they miss me?Åh she cried ecstatically.
ÅgThe whole town is desolate. All the cars have the left rear wheel painted black 
as a mourning wreath, and thereÅfs a persistent wail all night along the north 
shore.Åh
ÅgHow gorgeous! LetÅfs go back, Tom. To-morrow!Åh Then she added irrelevantly: ÅgYou 
ought to see the baby.Åh
ÅgIÅfd like to.Åh
ÅgSheÅfs asleep. SheÅfs three years old. HavenÅft you ever seen her?Åh
ÅgNever.Åh
ÅgWell, you ought to see her. SheÅfs&#8212;&#8212;Åh
Tom Buchanan, who had been hovering restlessly about the room, stopped and 
rested his hand on my shoulder.
ÅgWhat you doing, Nick?Åh
ÅgIÅfm a bond man.Åh
ÅgWho with?Åh
I told him.
ÅgNever heard of them,Åh he remarked decisively.
This annoyed me.
ÅgYou will,Åh I answered shortly. ÅgYou will if you stay in the East.Åh
ÅgOh, IÅfll stay in the East, donÅft you worry,Åh he said, glancing at Daisy and 
then back at me, as if he were alert for something more. ÅgIÅfd be a God damned 
fool to live anywhere else.Åh
At this point Miss Baker said: ÅgAbsolutely!Åh with such suddenness that I 
started&#8212;it was the first word she uttered since I came into the room. Evidently 
it surprised her as much as it did me, for she yawned and with a series of 
rapid, deft movements stood up into the room.
ÅgIÅfm stiff,Åh she complained, ÅgIÅfve been lying on that sofa for as long as I can 
remember.Åh
ÅgDonÅft look at me,Åh Daisy retorted, ÅgIÅfve been trying to get you to New York all 
afternoon.Åh
ÅgNo, thanks,Åh said Miss Baker to the four cocktails just in from the pantry, 
ÅgIÅfm absolutely in training.Åh
Her host looked at her incredulously.
ÅgYou are!Åh He took down his drink as if it were a drop in the bottom of a glass. 
ÅgHow you ever get anything done is beyond me.Åh
I looked at Miss Baker, wondering what it was she Åggot done.Åh I enjoyed looking 
at her. She was a slender, small-breasted girl, with an erect carriage, which 
she accentuated by throwing her body backward at the shoulders like a young 
cadet. Her gray sun-strained eyes looked back at me with polite reciprocal 
curiosity out of a wan, charming, discontented face. It occurred to me now that 
I had seen her, or a picture of her, somewhere before.
ÅgYou live in West Egg,Åh she remarked contemptuously. ÅgI know somebody there.Åh
ÅgI donÅft know a single&#8212;&#8212;Åh
ÅgYou must know Gatsby.Åh
ÅgGatsby?Åh demanded Daisy. ÅgWhat Gatsby?Åh
Before I could reply that he was my neighbor dinner was announced; wedging his 
tense arm imperatively under mine, Tom Buchanan compelled me from the room as 
though he were moving a checker to another square.
Slenderly, languidly, their hands set lightly on their hips, the two young women 
preceded us out onto a rosy-colored porch, open toward the sunset, where four 
candles flickered on the table in the diminished wind.
ÅgWhy CANDLES?Åh objected Daisy, frowning. She snapped them out with her fingers. 
ÅgIn two weeks itÅfll be the longest day in the year.Åh She looked at us all 
radiantly. ÅgDo you always watch for the longest day of the year and then miss 
it? I always watch for the longest day in the year and then miss it.Åh
ÅgWe ought to plan something,Åh yawned Miss Baker, sitting down at the table as if 
she were getting into bed.
ÅgAll right,Åh said Daisy. ÅgWhatÅfll we plan?Åh She turned to me helplessly: ÅgWhat 
do people plan?Åh
Before I could answer her eyes fastened with an awed expression on her little 
finger.
ÅgLook!Åh she complained; ÅgI hurt it.Åh
We all looked&#8212;the knuckle was black and blue.
ÅgYou did it, Tom,Åh she said accusingly. ÅgI know you didnÅft mean to, but you DID 
do it. ThatÅfs what I get for marrying a brute of a man, a great, big, hulking 
physical specimen of a&#8212;&#8212;Åh
ÅgI hate that word hulking,Åh objected Tom crossly, Ågeven in kidding.Åh
ÅgHulking,Åh insisted Daisy.
Sometimes she and Miss Baker talked at once, unobtrusively and with a bantering 
inconsequence that was never quite chatter, that was as cool as their white 
dresses and their impersonal eyes in the absence of all desire. They were here, 
and they accepted Tom and me, making only a polite pleasant effort to entertain 
or to be entertained. They knew that presently dinner would be over and a little 
later the evening too would be over and casually put away. It was sharply 
different from the West, where an evening was hurried from phase to phase toward 
its close, in a continually disappointed anticipation or else in sheer nervous 
dread of the moment itself.
ÅgYou make me feel uncivilized, Daisy,Åh I confessed on my second glass of corky 
but rather impressive claret. ÅgCanÅft you talk about crops or something?Åh
I meant nothing in particular by this remark, but it was taken up in an 
unexpected way.
ÅgCivilizationÅfs going to pieces,Åh broke out Tom violently. ÅgIÅfve gotten to be a 
terrible pessimist about things. Have you read ÅeThe Rise of the Colored EmpiresÅf 
by this man Goddard?Åh
ÅgWhy, no,Åh I answered, rather surprised by his tone.
ÅgWell, itÅfs a fine book, and everybody ought to read it. The idea is if we donÅft 
look out the white race will be&#8212;will be utterly submerged. ItÅfs all scientific 
stuff; itÅfs been proved.Åh
ÅgTomÅfs getting very profound,Åh said Daisy, with an expression of unthoughtful 
sadness. ÅgHe reads deep books with long words in them. What was that word we&#8212;&#8212;Åh
ÅgWell, these books are all scientific,Åh insisted Tom, glancing at her 
impatiently. ÅgThis fellow has worked out the whole thing. ItÅfs up to us, who are 
the dominant race, to watch out or these other races will have control of 
things.Åh
ÅgWeÅfve got to beat them down,Åh whispered Daisy, winking ferociously toward the 
fervent sun.
ÅgYou ought to live in California&#8212;Åh began Miss Baker, but Tom interrupted her by 
shifting heavily in his chair.
ÅgThis idea is that weÅfre Nordics. I am, and you are, and you are, and&#8212;&#8212;Åh After 
an infinitesimal hesitation he included Daisy with a slight nod, and she winked 
at me again. Åg&#8212;And weÅfve produced all the things that go to make 
civilization&#8212;oh, science and art, and all that. Do you see?Åh
There was something pathetic in his concentration, as if his complacency, more 
acute than of old, was not enough to him any more. When, almost immediately, the 
telephone rang inside and the butler left the porch Daisy seized upon the 
momentary interruption and leaned toward me.
ÅgIÅfll tell you a family secret,Åh she whispered enthusiastically. ÅgItÅfs about the 
butlerÅfs nose. Do you want to hear about the butlerÅfs nose?Åh
ÅgThatÅfs why I came over to-night.Åh
ÅgWell, he wasnÅft always a butler; he used to be the silver polisher for some 
people in New York that had a silver service for two hundred people. He had to 
polish it from morning till night, until finally it began to affect his nose&#8212;&#8212;Åh
ÅgThings went from bad to worse,Åh suggested Miss Baker.
ÅgYes. Things went from bad to worse, until finally he had to give up his 
position.Åh
For a moment the last sunshine fell with romantic affection upon her glowing 
face; her voice compelled me forward breathlessly as I listened&#8212;then the glow 
faded, each light deserting her with lingering regret, like children leaving a 
pleasant street at dusk.
The butler came back and murmured something close to TomÅfs ear, whereupon Tom 
frowned, pushed back his chair, and without a word went inside. As if his 
absence quickened something within her, Daisy leaned forward again, her voice 
glowing and singing.
ÅgI love to see you at my table, Nick. You remind me of a&#8212;of a rose, an absolute 
rose. DoesnÅft he?Åh She turned to Miss Baker for confirmation: ÅgAn absolute 
rose?Åh
This was untrue. I am not even faintly like a rose. She was only extemporizing, 
but a stirring warmth flowed from her, as if her heart was trying to come out to 
you concealed in one of those breathless, thrilling words. Then suddenly she 
threw her napkin on the table and excused herself and went into the house.
Miss Baker and I exchanged a short glance consciously devoid of meaning. I was 
about to speak when she sat up alertly and said ÅgSh!Åh in a warning voice. A 
subdued impassioned murmur was audible in the room beyond, and Miss Baker leaned 
forward unashamed, trying to hear. The murmur trembled on the verge of 
coherence, sank down, mounted excitedly, and then ceased altogether.
ÅgThis Mr. Gatsby you spoke of is my neighbor&#8212;&#8212;Åh I said.
ÅgDonÅft talk. I want to hear what happens.Åh
ÅgIs something happening?Åh I inquired innocently.
ÅgYou mean to say you donÅft know?Åh said Miss Baker, honestly surprised. ÅgI 
thought everybody knew.Åh
ÅgI donÅft.Åh
ÅgWhy&#8212;&#8212;Åh she said hesitantly, ÅgTomÅfs got some woman in New York.Åh
ÅgGot some woman?Åh I repeated blankly.
Miss Baker nodded.
ÅgShe might have the decency not to telephone him at dinner time. DonÅft you 
think?Åh
Almost before I had grasped her meaning there was the flutter of a dress and the 
crunch of leather boots, and Tom and Daisy were back at the table.
ÅgIt couldnÅft be helped!Åh cried Daisy with tense gaiety.
She sat down, glanced searchingly at Miss Baker and then at me, and continued: 
ÅgI looked outdoors for a minute, and itÅfs very romantic outdoors. ThereÅfs a bird 
on the lawn that I think must be a nightingale come over on the Cunard or White 
Star Line. HeÅfs singing away&#8212;&#8212;Åh Her voice sang: ÅgItÅfs romantic, isnÅft it, Tom?Åh
ÅgVery romantic,Åh he said, and then miserably to me: ÅgIf itÅfs light enough after 
dinner, I want to take you down to the stables.Åh
The telephone rang inside, startlingly, and as Daisy shook her head decisively 
at Tom the subject of the stables, in fact all subjects, vanished into air. 
Among the broken fragments of the last five minutes at table I remember the 
candles being lit again, pointlessly, and I was conscious of wanting to look 
squarely at every one, and yet to avoid all eyes. I couldnÅft guess what Daisy 
and Tom were thinking, but I doubt if even Miss Baker, who seemed to have 
mastered a certain hardy scepticism, was able utterly to put this fifth guestÅfs 
shrill metallic urgency out of mind. To a certain temperament the situation 
might have seemed intriguing&#8212;my own instinct was to telephone immediately for 
the police.
The horses, needless to say, were not mentioned again. Tom and Miss Baker, with 
several feet of twilight between them, strolled back into the library, as if to 
a vigil beside a perfectly tangible body, while, trying to look pleasantly 
interested and a little deaf, I followed Daisy around a chain of connecting 
verandas to the porch in front. In its deep gloom we sat down side by side on a 
wicker settee.
Daisy took her face in her hands as if feeling its lovely shape, and her eyes 
moved gradually out into the velvet dusk. I saw that turbulent emotions 
possessed her, so I asked what I thought would be some sedative questions about 
her little girl.
ÅgWe donÅft know each other very well, Nick,Åh she said suddenly. ÅgEven if we are 
cousins. You didnÅft come to my wedding.Åh
ÅgI wasnÅft back from the war.Åh
ÅgThatÅfs true.Åh She hesitated. ÅgWell, IÅfve had a very bad time, Nick, and IÅfm 
pretty cynical about everything.Åh
Evidently she had reason to be. I waited but she didnÅft say any more, and after 
a moment I returned rather feebly to the subject of her daughter.
ÅgI suppose she talks, and&#8212;eats, and everything.Åh
ÅgOh, yes.Åh She looked at me absently. ÅgListen, Nick; let me tell you what I said 
when she was born. Would you like to hear?Åh
ÅgVery much.Åh
ÅgItÅfll show you how IÅfve gotten to feel about&#8212;things. Well, she was less than an 
hour old and Tom was God knows where. I woke up out of the ether with an utterly 
abandoned feeling, and asked the nurse right away if it was a boy or a girl. She 
told me it was a girl, and so I turned my head away and wept. Åeall right,Åf I 
said, ÅeIÅfm glad itÅfs a girl. And I hope sheÅfll be a fool&#8212;thatÅfs the best thing a 
girl can be in this world, a beautiful little fool.Åh
ÅgYou see I think everythingÅfs terrible anyhow,Åh she went on in a convinced way. 
ÅgEverybody thinks so&#8212;the most advanced people. And I KNOW. IÅfve been everywhere 
and seen everything and done everything.Åh Her eyes flashed around her in a 
defiant way, rather like TomÅfs, and she laughed with thrilling scorn. 
ÅgSophisticated&#8212;God, IÅfm sophisticated!Åh
The instant her voice broke off, ceasing to compel my attention, my belief, I 
felt the basic insincerity of what she had said. It made me uneasy, as though 
the whole evening had been a trick of some sort to exact a contributory emotion 
from me. I waited, and sure enough, in a moment she looked at me with an 
absolute smirk on her lovely face, as if she had asserted her membership in a 
rather distinguished secret society to which she and Tom belonged.
Inside, the crimson room bloomed with light.
Tom and Miss Baker sat at either end of the long couch and she read aloud to him 
from the SATURDAY EVENING POST.&#8212;the words, murmurous and uninflected, running 
together in a soothing tune. The lamp-light, bright on his boots and dull on the 
autumn-leaf yellow of her hair, glinted along the paper as she turned a page 
with a flutter of slender muscles in her arms.
When we came in she held us silent for a moment with a lifted hand.
ÅgTo be continued,Åh she said, tossing the magazine on the table, Ågin our very 
next issue.Åh
Her body asserted itself with a restless movement of her knee, and she stood up.
ÅgTen oÅfclock,Åh she remarked, apparently finding the time on the ceiling. ÅgTime 
for this good girl to go to bed.Åh
ÅgJordanÅfs going to play in the tournament to-morrow,Åh explained Daisy, Ågover at 
Westchester.Åh
ÅgOh&#8212;youÅfre Jordan BAKER.Åh
I knew now why her face was familiar&#8212;its pleasing contemptuous expression had 
looked out at me from many rotogravure pictures of the sporting life at 
Asheville and Hot Springs and Palm Beach. I had heard some story of her too, a 
critical, unpleasant story, but what it was I had forgotten long ago.
ÅgGood night,Åh she said softly. ÅgWake me at eight, wonÅft you.Åh
ÅgIf youÅfll get up.Åh
ÅgI will. Good night, Mr. Carraway. See you anon.Åh
ÅgOf course you will,Åh confirmed Daisy. ÅgIn fact I think IÅfll arrange a marriage. 
Come over often, Nick, and IÅfll sort of&#8212;oh&#8212;fling you together. You know&#8212;lock you 
up accidentally in linen closets and push you out to sea in a boat, and all that 
sort of thing&#8212;&#8212;Åh
ÅgGood night,Åh called Miss Baker from the stairs. ÅgI havenÅft heard a word.Åh
ÅgSheÅfs a nice girl,Åh said Tom after a moment. ÅgThey oughtnÅft to let her run 
around the country this way.Åh
ÅgWho oughtnÅft to?Åh inquired Daisy coldly.
ÅgHer family.Åh
ÅgHer family is one aunt about a thousand years old. Besides, NickÅfs going to 
look after her, arenÅft you, Nick? SheÅfs going to spend lots of week-ends out 
here this summer. I think the home influence will be very good for her.Åh
Daisy and Tom looked at each other for a moment in silence.
ÅgIs she from New York?Åh I asked quickly.
ÅgFrom Louisville. Our white girlhood was passed together there. Our beautiful 
white&#8212;&#8212;Åh
ÅgDid you give Nick a little heart to heart talk on the veranda?Åh demanded Tom 
suddenly.
ÅgDid I?Åh She looked at me.
ÅgI canÅft seem to remember, but I think we talked about the Nordic race. Yes, IÅfm 
sure we did. It sort of crept up on us and first thing you know&#8212;&#8212;Åh
ÅgDonÅft believe everything you hear, Nick,Åh he advised me.
I said lightly that I had heard nothing at all, and a few minutes later I got up 
to go home. They came to the door with me and stood side by side in a cheerful 
square of light. As I started my motor Daisy peremptorily called: ÅgWait!Åh
ÅgI forgot to ask you something, and itÅfs important. We heard you were engaged to 
a girl out West.Åh
ÅgThatÅfs right,Åh corroborated Tom kindly. ÅgWe heard that you were engaged.Åh
ÅgItÅfs libel. IÅfm too poor.Åh
ÅgBut we heard it,Åh insisted Daisy, surprising me by opening up again in a 
flower-like way. ÅgWe heard it from three people, so it must be true.Åh
Of course I knew what they were referring to, but I wasnÅft even vaguely engaged. 
The fact that gossip had published the banns was one of the reasons I had come 
East. You canÅft stop going with an old friend on account of rumors, and on the 
other hand I had no intention of being rumored into marriage.
Their interest rather touched me and made them less remotely rich&#8212;nevertheless, 
I was confused and a little disgusted as I drove away. It seemed to me that the 
thing for Daisy to do was to rush out of the house, child in arms&#8212;but apparently 
there were no such intentions in her head. As for Tom, the fact that he Åghad 
some woman in New York.Åh was really less surprising than that he had been 
depressed by a book. Something was making him nibble at the edge of stale ideas 
as if his sturdy physical egotism no longer nourished his peremptory heart.
Already it was deep summer on roadhouse roofs and in front of wayside garages, 
where new red gas-pumps sat out in pools of light, and when I reached my estate 
at West Egg I ran the car under its shed and sat for a while on an abandoned 
grass roller in the yard. The wind had blown off, leaving a loud, bright night, 
with wings beating in the trees and a persistent organ sound as the full bellows 
of the earth blew the frogs full of life. The silhouette of a moving cat wavered 
across the moonlight, and turning my head to watch it, I saw that I was not 
alone&#8212;fifty feet away a figure had emerged from the shadow of my neighborÅfs 
mansion and was standing with his hands in his pockets regarding the silver 
pepper of the stars. Something in his leisurely movements and the secure 
position of his feet upon the lawn suggested that it was Mr. Gatsby himself, 
come out to determine what share was his of our local heavens.
I decided to call to him. Miss Baker had mentioned him at dinner, and that would 
do for an introduction. But I didnÅft call to him, for he gave a sudden 
intimation that he was content to be alone&#8212;he stretched out his arms toward the 
dark water in a curious way, and, far as I was from him, I could have sworn he 
was trembling. Involuntarily I glanced seaward&#8212;and distinguished nothing except 
a single green light, minute and far away, that might have been the end of a 
dock. When I looked once more for Gatsby he had vanished, and I was alone again 
in the unquiet darkness.
Chapter 2
About half way between West Egg and New York the motor road hastily joins the 
railroad and runs beside it for a quarter of a mile, so as to shrink away from a 
certain desolate area of land. This is a valley of ashes&#8212;a fantastic farm where 
ashes grow like wheat into ridges and hills and grotesque gardens; where ashes 
take the forms of houses and chimneys and rising smoke and, finally, with a 
transcendent effort, of men who move dimly and already crumbling through the 
powdery air. Occasionally a line of gray cars crawls along an invisible track, 
gives out a ghastly creak, and comes to rest, and immediately the ash-gray men 
swarm up with leaden spades and stir up an impenetrable cloud, which screens 
their obscure operations from your sight. But above the gray land and the spasms 
of bleak dust which drift endlessly over it, you perceive, after a moment, the 
eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg. The eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg are blue and 
gigantic&#8212;their irises are one yard high. They look out of no face, but, instead, 
from a pair of enormous yellow spectacles which pass over a nonexistent nose. 
Evidently some wild wag of an oculist set them there to fatten his practice in 
the borough of Queens, and then sank down himself into eternal blindness, or 
forgot them and moved away. But his eyes, dimmed a little by many paintless 
days, under sun and rain, brood on over the solemn dumping ground.
The valley of ashes is bounded on one side by a small foul river, and, when the 
drawbridge is up to let barges through, the passengers on waiting trains can 
stare at the dismal scene for as long as half an hour. There is always a halt 
there of at least a minute, and it was because of this that I first met Tom 
BuchananÅfs mistress.
The fact that he had one was insisted upon wherever he was known. His 
acquaintances resented the fact that he turned up in popular restaurants with 
her and, leaving her at a table, sauntered about, chatting with whomsoever he 
knew. Though I was curious to see her, I had no desire to meet her&#8212;but I did. I 
went up to New York with Tom on the train one afternoon, and when we stopped by 
the ashheaps he jumped to his feet and, taking hold of my elbow, literally 
forced me from the car.
ÅgWeÅfre getting off,Åh he insisted. ÅgI want you to meet my girl.Åh
I think heÅfd tanked up a good deal at luncheon, and his determination to have my 
company bordered on violence. The supercilious assumption was that on Sunday 
afternoon I had nothing better to do.
I followed him over a low whitewashed railroad fence, and we walked back a 
hundred yards along the road under Doctor EckleburgÅfs persistent stare. The only 
building in sight was a small block of yellow brick sitting on the edge of the 
waste land, a sort of compact Main Street ministering to it, and contiguous to 
absolutely nothing. One of the three shops it contained was for rent and another 
was an all-night restaurant, approached by a trail of ashes; the third was a 
garage&#8212;Repairs. GEORGE B. WILSON. Cars bought and sold.&#8212;and I followed Tom 
inside.
The interior was unprosperous and bare; the only car visible was the 
dust-covered wreck of a Ford which crouched in a dim corner. It had occurred to 
me that this shadow of a garage must be a blind, and that sumptuous and romantic 
apartments were concealed overhead, when the proprietor himself appeared in the 
door of an office, wiping his hands on a piece of waste. He was a blond, 
spiritless man, anaemic, and faintly handsome. When he saw us a damp gleam of 
hope sprang into his light blue eyes.
ÅgHello, Wilson, old man,Åh said Tom, slapping him jovially on the shoulder. 
ÅgHowÅfs business?Åh
ÅgI canÅft complain,Åh answered Wilson unconvincingly. ÅgWhen are you going to sell 
me that car?Åh
ÅgNext week; IÅfve got my man working on it now.Åh
ÅgWorks pretty slow, donÅft he?Åh
ÅgNo, he doesnÅft,Åh said Tom coldly. ÅgAnd if you feel that way about it, maybe IÅfd 
better sell it somewhere else after all.Åh
ÅgI donÅft mean that,Åh explained Wilson quickly. ÅgI just meant&#8212;&#8212;Åh
His voice faded off and Tom glanced impatiently around the garage. Then I heard 
footsteps on a stairs, and in a moment the thickish figure of a woman blocked 
out the light from the office door. She was in the middle thirties, and faintly 
stout, but she carried her surplus flesh sensuously as some women can. Her face, 
above a spotted dress of dark blue crepe-de-chine, contained no facet or gleam 
of beauty, but there was an immediately perceptible vitality about her as if the 
nerves of her body were continually smouldering. She smiled slowly and, walking 
through her husband as if he were a ghost, shook hands with Tom, looking him 
flush in the eye. Then she wet her lips, and without turning around spoke to her 
husband in a soft, coarse voice:
ÅgGet some chairs, why donÅft you, so somebody can sit down.Åh
ÅgOh, sure,Åh agreed Wilson hurriedly, and went toward the little office, mingling 
immediately with the cement color of the walls. A white ashen dust veiled his 
dark suit and his pale hair as it veiled everything in the vicinity&#8212;except his 
wife, who moved close to Tom.
ÅgI want to see you,Åh said Tom intently. ÅgGet on the next train.Åh
ÅgAll right.Åh
ÅgIÅfll meet you by the news-stand on the lower level.Åh She nodded and moved away 
from him just as George Wilson emerged with two chairs from his office door.
We waited for her down the road and out of sight. It was a few days before the 
Fourth of July, and a gray, scrawny Italian child was setting torpedoes in a row 
along the railroad track.
ÅgTerrible place, isnÅft it,Åh said Tom, exchanging a frown with Doctor Eckleburg.
ÅgAwful.Åh
ÅgIt does her good to get away.Åh
ÅgDoesnÅft her husband object?Åh
ÅgWilson? He thinks she goes to see her sister in New York. HeÅfs so dumb he 
doesnÅft know heÅfs alive.Åh
So Tom Buchanan and his girl and I went up together to New York&#8212;or not quite 
together, for Mrs. Wilson sat discreetly in another car. Tom deferred that much 
to the sensibilities of those East Eggers who might be on the train.
She had changed her dress to a brown figured muslin, which stretched tight over 
her rather wide hips as Tom helped her to the platform in New York. At the 
news-stand she bought a copy of TOWN TATTLE. and a moving-picture magazine, and 
in the station drug-store some cold cream and a small flask of perfume. 
Up-stairs, in the solemn echoing drive she let four taxicabs drive away before 
she selected a new one, lavender-colored with gray upholstery, and in this we 
slid out from the mass of the station into the glowing sunshine. But immediately 
she turned sharply from the window and, leaning forward, tapped on the front 
glass.
ÅgI want to get one of those dogs,Åh she said earnestly. ÅgI want to get one for 
the apartment. TheyÅfre nice to have&#8212;a dog.Åh
We backed up to a gray old man who bore an absurd resemblance to John D. 
Rockefeller. In a basket swung from his neck cowered a dozen very recent puppies 
of an indeterminate breed.
ÅgWhat kind are they?Åh asked Mrs. Wilson eagerly, as he came to the taxi-window.
ÅgAll kinds. What kind do you want, lady?Åh
ÅgIÅfd like to get one of those police dogs; I donÅft suppose you got that kind?Åh
The man peered doubtfully into the basket, plunged in his hand and drew one up, 
wriggling, by the back of the neck.
ÅgThatÅfs no police dog,Åh said Tom.
ÅgNo, itÅfs not exactly a polICE dog,Åh said the man with disappointment in his 
voice. ÅgItÅfs more of an Airedale.Åh He passed his hand over the brown wash-rag of 
a back. ÅgLook at that coat. Some coat. ThatÅfs a dog thatÅfll never bother you 
with catching cold.Åh
ÅgI think itÅfs cute,Åh said Mrs. Wilson enthusiastically. ÅgHow much is it?Åh
ÅgThat dog?Åh He looked at it admiringly. ÅgThat dog will cost you ten dollars.Åh
The Airedale&#8212;undoubtedly there was an Airedale concerned in it somewhere, though 
its feet were startlingly white&#8212;changed hands and settled down into Mrs. 
WilsonÅfs lap, where she fondled the weather-proof coat with rapture.
ÅgIs it a boy or a girl?Åh she asked delicately.
ÅgThat dog? That dogÅfs a boy.Åh
ÅgItÅfs a bitch,Åh said Tom decisively. ÅgHereÅfs your money. Go and buy ten more 
dogs with it.Åh
We drove over to Fifth Avenue, so warm and soft, almost pastoral, on the summer 
Sunday afternoon that I wouldnÅft have been surprised to see a great flock of 
white sheep turn the corner.
ÅgHold on,Åh I said, ÅgI have to leave you here.Åh
ÅgNo, you donÅft,Åh interposed Tom quickly.
ÅgMyrtleÅfll be hurt if you donÅft come up to the apartment. WonÅft you, Myrtle?Åh
ÅgCome on,Åh she urged. ÅgIÅfll telephone my sister Catherine. SheÅfs said to be very 
beautiful by people who ought to know.Åh
ÅgWell, IÅfd like to, but&#8212;&#8212;Åh
We went on, cutting back again over the Park toward the West Hundreds. At 158th 
Street the cab stopped at one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses. 
Throwing a regal homecoming glance around the neighborhood, Mrs. Wilson gathered 
up her dog and her other purchases, and went haughtily in.
ÅgIÅfm going to have the McKees come up,Åh she announced as we rose in the 
elevator. ÅgAnd, of course, I got to call up my sister, too.Åh
The apartment was on the top floor&#8212;a small living-room, a small dining-room, a 
small bedroom, and a bath. The living-room was crowded to the doors with a set 
of tapestried furniture entirely too large for it, so that to move about was to 
stumble continually over scenes of ladies swinging in the gardens of Versailles. 
The only picture was an over-enlarged photograph, apparently a hen sitting on a 
blurred rock. Looked at from a distance, however, the hen resolved itself into a 
bonnet, and the countenance of a stout old lady beamed down into the room. 
Several old copies of TOWN TATTLE. lay on the table together with a copy of 
SIMON CALLED PETER, and some of the small scandal magazines of Broadway. Mrs. 
Wilson was first concerned with the dog. A reluctant elevator-boy went for a box 
full of straw and some milk, to which he added on his own initiative a tin of 
large, hard dog-biscuits&#8212;one of which decomposed apathetically in the saucer of 
milk all afternoon. Meanwhile Tom brought out a bottle of whiskey from a locked 
bureau door.
I have been drunk just twice in my life, and the second time was that afternoon; 
so everything that happened has a dim, hazy cast over it, although until after 
eight oÅfclock the apartment was full of cheerful sun. Sitting on TomÅfs lap Mrs. 
Wilson called up several people on the telephone; then there were no cigarettes, 
and I went out to buy some at the drugstore on the corner. When I came back they 
had disappeared, so I sat down discreetly in the living-room and read a chapter 
of SIMON CALLED PETER.&#8212;either it was terrible stuff or the whiskey distorted 
things, because it didnÅft make any sense to me.
Just as Tom and Myrtle (after the first drink Mrs. Wilson and I called each 
other by our first names) reappeared, company commenced to arrive at the 
apartment-door.
The sister, Catherine, was a slender, worldly girl of about thirty, with a 
solid, sticky bob of red hair, and a complexion powdered milky white. Her 
eye-brows had been plucked and then drawn on again at a more rakish angle, but 
the efforts of nature toward the restoration of the old alignment gave a blurred 
air to her face. When she moved about there was an incessant clicking as 
innumerable pottery bracelets jingled up and down upon her arms. She came in 
with such a proprietary haste, and looked around so possessively at the 
furniture that I wondered if she lived here. But when I asked her she laughed 
immoderately, repeated my question aloud, and told me she lived with a girl 
friend at a hotel.
Mr. McKee was a pale, feminine man from the flat below. He had just shaved, for 
there was a white spot of lather on his cheekbone, and he was most respectful in 
his greeting to every one in the room. He informed me that he was in the 
Ågartistic game,Åh and I gathered later that he was a photographer and had made 
the dim enlargement of Mrs. WilsonÅfs mother which hovered like an ectoplasm on 
the wall. His wife was shrill, languid, handsome, and horrible. She told me with 
pride that her husband had photographed her a hundred and twenty-seven times 
since they had been married.
Mrs. Wilson had changed her costume some time before, and was now attired in an 
elaborate afternoon dress of cream-colored chiffon, which gave out a continual 
rustle as she swept about the room. With the influence of the dress her 
personality had also undergone a change. The intense vitality that had been so 
remarkable in the garage was converted into impressive hauteur. Her laughter, 
her gestures, her assertions became more violently affected moment by moment, 
and as she expanded the room grew smaller around her, until she seemed to be 
revolving on a noisy, creaking pivot through the smoky air.
ÅgMy dear,Åh she told her sister in a high, mincing shout, Ågmost of these fellas 
will cheat you every time. All they think of is money. I had a woman up here 
last week to look at my feet, and when she gave me the bill youÅfd of thought she 
had my appendicitis out.Åh
ÅgWhat was the name of the woman?Åh asked Mrs. McKee.
ÅgMrs. Eberhardt. She goes around looking at peopleÅfs feet in their own homes.Åh
ÅgI like your dress,Åh remarked Mrs. McKee, ÅgI think itÅfs adorable.Åh
Mrs. Wilson rejected the compliment by raising her eyebrow in disdain.
ÅgItÅfs just a crazy old thing,Åh she said. ÅgI just slip it on sometimes when I 
donÅft care what I look like.Åh
ÅgBut it looks wonderful on you, if you know what I mean,Åh pursued Mrs. McKee. 
ÅgIf Chester could only get you in that pose I think he could make something of 
it.Åh
We all looked in silence at Mrs. Wilson, who removed a strand of hair from over 
her eyes and looked back at us with a brilliant smile. Mr. McKee regarded her 
intently with his head on one side, and then moved his hand back and forth 
slowly in front of his face.
ÅgI should change the light,Åh he said after a moment. ÅgIÅfd like to bring out the 
modelling of the features. And IÅfd try to get hold of all the back hair.Åh
ÅgI wouldnÅft think of changing the light,Åh cried Mrs. McKee. ÅgI think itÅfs&#8212;&#8212;Åh
Her husband said ÅgSH!Åh and we all looked at the subject again, whereupon Tom 
Buchanan yawned audibly and got to his feet.
ÅgYou McKees have something to drink,Åh he said. ÅgGet some more ice and mineral 
water, Myrtle, before everybody goes to sleep.Åh
ÅgI told that boy about the ice.Åh Myrtle raised her eyebrows in despair at the 
shiftlessness of the lower orders. ÅgThese people! You have to keep after them 
all the time.Åh
She looked at me and laughed pointlessly. Then she flounced over to the dog, 
kissed it with ecstasy, and swept into the kitchen, implying that a dozen chefs 
awaited her orders there.
ÅgIÅfve done some nice things out on Long Island,Åh asserted Mr. McKee.
Tom looked at him blankly.
ÅgTwo of them we have framed down-stairs.Åh
ÅgTwo what?Åh demanded Tom.
ÅgTwo studies. One of them I call MONTAUK POINT&#8212;THE GULLS, and the other I call 
MONTAUK POINT&#8212;THE SEA.Åh
The sister Catherine sat down beside me on the couch.
ÅgDo you live down on Long Island, too?Åh she inquired.
ÅgI live at West Egg.Åh
ÅgReally? I was down there at a party about a month ago. At a man named GatsbyÅfs. 
Do you know him?Åh
ÅgI live next door to him.Åh
ÅgWell, they say heÅfs a nephew or a cousin of Kaiser WilhelmÅfs. ThatÅfs where all 
his money comes from.Åh
ÅgReally?Åh
She nodded.
ÅgIÅfm scared of him. IÅfd hate to have him get anything on me.Åh
This absorbing information about my neighbor was interrupted by Mrs. McKeeÅfs 
pointing suddenly at Catherine:
ÅgChester, I think you could do something with HER,Åh she broke out, but Mr. McKee 
only nodded in a bored way, and turned his attention to Tom.
ÅgIÅfd like to do more work on Long Island, if I could get the entry. All I ask is 
that they should give me a start.Åh
ÅgAsk Myrtle,Åh said Tom, breaking into a short shout of laughter as Mrs. Wilson 
entered with a tray. ÅgSheÅfll give you a letter of introduction, wonÅft you 
Myrtle?Åh
ÅgDo what?Åh she asked, startled.
ÅgYouÅfll give McKee a letter of introduction to your husband, so he can do some 
studies of him.Åh His lips moved silently for a moment as he invented. ÅgGEORGE B. 
WILSON AT THE GASOLINE PUMP, or something like that.Åh
Catherine leaned close to me and whispered in my ear: ÅgNeither of them can stand 
the person theyÅfre married to.Åh
ÅgCanÅft they?Åh
ÅgCanÅft STAND them.Åh She looked at Myrtle and then at Tom. ÅgWhat I say is, why go 
on living with them if they canÅft stand them? If I was them IÅfd get a divorce 
and get married to each other right away.Åh
ÅgDoesnÅft she like Wilson either?Åh
The answer to this was unexpected. It came from Myrtle, who had overheard the 
question, and it was violent and obscene.
ÅgYou see,Åh cried Catherine triumphantly. She lowered her voice again. ÅgItÅfs 
really his wife thatÅfs keeping them apart. SheÅfs a Catholic, and they donÅft 
believe in divorce.Åh
Daisy was not a Catholic, and I was a little shocked at the elaborateness of the 
lie.
ÅgWhen they do get married,Åh continued Catherine, ÅgtheyÅfre going West to live for 
a while until it blows over.Åh
ÅgItÅfd be more discreet to go to Europe.Åh
ÅgOh, do you like Europe?Åh she exclaimed surprisingly. ÅgI just got back from 
Monte Carlo.Åh
ÅgReally.Åh
ÅgJust last year. I went over there with another girl.Åh ÅgStay long?Åh
ÅgNo, we just went to Monte Carlo and back. We went by way of Marseilles. We had 
over twelve hundred dollars when we started, but we got gypped out of it all in 
two days in the private rooms. We had an awful time getting back, I can tell 
you. God, how I hated that town!Åh
The late afternoon sky bloomed in the window for a moment like the blue honey of 
the Mediterranean&#8212;then the shrill voice of Mrs. McKee called me back into the 
room.
ÅgI almost made a mistake, too,Åh she declared vigorously. ÅgI almost married a 
little kyke whoÅfd been after me for years. I knew he was below me. Everybody 
kept saying to me: ÅeLucille, that manÅfs Åeway below you!Åf But if I hadnÅft met 
Chester, heÅfd of got me sure.Åh
ÅgYes, but listen,Åh said Myrtle Wilson, nodding her head up and down, Ågat least 
you didnÅft marry him.Åh
ÅgI know I didnÅft.Åh
ÅgWell, I married him,Åh said Myrtle, ambiguously. ÅgAnd thatÅfs the difference 
between your case and mine.Åh
ÅgWhy did you, Myrtle?Åh demanded Catherine. ÅgNobody forced you to.Åh
Myrtle considered.
ÅgI married him because I thought he was a gentleman,Åh she said finally. ÅgI 
thought he knew something about breeding, but he wasnÅft fit to lick my shoe.Åh
ÅgYou were crazy about him for a while,Åh said Catherine.
ÅgCrazy about him!Åh cried Myrtle incredulously. ÅgWho said I was crazy about him? 
I never was any more crazy about him than I was about that man there.Åh
She pointed suddenly at me, and every one looked at me accusingly. I tried to 
show by my expression that I had played no part in her past.
ÅgThe only CRAZY I was was when I married him. I knew right away I made a 
mistake. He borrowed somebodyÅfs best suit to get married in, and never even told 
me about it, and the man came after it one day when he was out. Åeoh, is that 
your suit?Åf I said. Åethis is the first I ever heard about it.Åf But I gave it to 
him and then I lay down and cried to beat the band all afternoon.Åh
ÅgShe really ought to get away from him,Åh resumed Catherine to me. ÅgTheyÅfve been 
living over that garage for eleven years. And tomÅfs the first sweetie she ever 
had.Åh
The bottle of whiskey&#8212;a second one&#8212;was now in constant demand by all present, 
excepting Catherine, who Ågfelt just as good on nothing at all.Åh Tom rang for the 
janitor and sent him for some celebrated sandwiches, which were a complete 
supper in themselves. I wanted to get out and walk southward toward the park 
through the soft twilight, but each time I tried to go I became entangled in 
some wild, strident argument which pulled me back, as if with ropes, into my 
chair. Yet high over the city our line of yellow windows must have contributed 
their share of human secrecy to the casual watcher in the darkening streets, and 
I was him too, looking up and wondering. I was within and without, 
simultaneously enchanted and repelled by the inexhaustible variety of life.
Myrtle pulled her chair close to mine, and suddenly her warm breath poured over 
me the story of her first meeting with Tom.
ÅgIt was on the two little seats facing each other that are always the last ones 
left on the train. I was going up to New York to see my sister and spend the 
night. He had on a dress suit and patent leather shoes, and I couldnÅft keep my 
eyes off him, but every time he looked at me I had to pretend to be looking at 
the advertisement over his head. When we came into the station he was next to 
me, and his white shirt-front pressed against my arm, and so I told him IÅfd have 
to call a policeman, but he knew I lied. I was so excited that when I got into a 
taxi with him I didnÅft hardly know I wasnÅft getting into a subway train. All I 
kept thinking about, over and over, was ÅeYou canÅft live forever; you canÅft live 
forever.ÅfÅh
She turned to Mrs. McKee and the room rang full of her artificial laughter.
ÅgMy dear,Åh she cried, ÅgIÅfm going to give you this dress as soon as IÅfm through 
with it. IÅfve got to get another one to-morrow. IÅfm going to make a list of all 
the things IÅfve got to get. A massage and a wave, and a collar for the dog, and 
one of those cute little ash-trays where you touch a spring, and a wreath with a 
black silk bow for motherÅfs grave thatÅfll last all summer. I got to write down a 
list so I wonÅft forget all the things I got to do.Åh
It was nine oÅfclock&#8212;almost immediately afterward I looked at my watch and found 
it was ten. Mr. McKee was asleep on a chair with his fists clenched in his lap, 
like a photograph of a man of action. Taking out my handkerchief I wiped from 
his cheek the remains of the spot of dried lather that had worried me all the 
afternoon.
The little dog was sitting on the table looking with blind eyes through the 
smoke, and from time to time groaning faintly. People disappeared, reappeared, 
made plans to go somewhere, and then lost each other, searched for each other, 
found each other a few feet away. Some time toward midnight Tom Buchanan and 
Mrs. Wilson stood face to face discussing, in impassioned voices, whether Mrs. 
Wilson had any right to mention DaisyÅfs name.
ÅgDaisy! Daisy! Daisy!Åh shouted Mrs. Wilson. ÅgIÅfll say it whenever I want to! 
Daisy! Dai&#8212;&#8212;Åh
Making a short deft movement, Tom Buchanan broke her nose with his open hand.
Then there were bloody towels upon the bath-room floor, and womenÅfs voices 
scolding, and high over the confusion a long broken wail of pain. Mr. McKee 
awoke from his doze and started in a daze toward the door. When he had gone half 
way he turned around and stared at the scene&#8212;his wife and Catherine scolding and 
consoling as they stumbled here and there among the crowded furniture with 
articles of aid, and the despairing figure on the couch, bleeding fluently, and 
trying to spread a copy of TOWN TATTLE. over the tapestry scenes of Versailles. 
Then Mr. McKee turned and continued on out the door. Taking my hat from the 
chandelier, I followed.
ÅgCome to lunch some day,Åh he suggested, as we groaned down in the elevator.
ÅgWhere?Åh
ÅgAnywhere.Åh
ÅgKeep your hands off the lever,Åh snapped the elevator boy.
ÅgI beg your pardon,Åh said Mr. McKee with dignity, ÅgI didnÅft know I was touching 
it.Åh
ÅgAll right,Åh I agreed, ÅgIÅfll be glad to.Åh
. . . I was standing beside his bed and he was sitting up between the sheets, 
clad in his underwear, with a great portfolio in his hands.
ÅgBeauty and the Beast . . . Loneliness . . . Old Grocery Horse . . . BrookÅfn 
Bridge . . . .Åh
Then I was lying half asleep in the cold lower level of the Pennsylvania 
Station, staring at the morning TRIBUNE, and waiting for the four oÅfclock train.
Chapter 3
There was music from my neighborÅfs house through the summer nights. In his blue 
gardens men and girls came and went like moths among the whisperings and the 
champagne and the stars. At high tide in the afternoon I watched his guests 
diving from the tower of his raft, or taking the sun on the hot sand of his 
beach while his two motor-boats slit the waters of the Sound, drawing aquaplanes 
over cataracts of foam. On week-ends his Rolls-Royce became an omnibus, bearing 
parties to and from the city between nine in the morning and long past midnight, 
while his station wagon scampered like a brisk yellow bug to meet all trains. 
And on Mondays eight servants, including an extra gardener, toiled all day with 
mops and scrubbing-brushes and hammers and garden-shears, repairing the ravages 
of the night before.
Every Friday five crates of oranges and lemons arrived from a fruiterer in New 
York&#8212;every Monday these same oranges and lemons left his back door in a pyramid 
of pulpless halves. There was a machine in the kitchen which could extract the 
juice of two hundred oranges in half an hour if a little button was pressed two 
hundred times by a butlerÅfs thumb.
At least once a fortnight a corps of caterers came down with several hundred 
feet of canvas and enough colored lights to make a Christmas tree of GatsbyÅfs 
enormous garden. On buffet tables, garnished with glistening hors-dÅfoeuvre, 
spiced baked hams crowded against salads of harlequin designs and pastry pigs 
and turkeys bewitched to a dark gold. In the main hall a bar with a real brass 
rail was set up, and stocked with gins and liquors and with cordials so long 
forgotten that most of his female guests were too young to know one from 
another.
By seven oÅfclock the orchestra has arrived, no thin five-piece affair, but a 
whole pitful of oboes and trombones and saxophones and viols and cornets and 
piccolos, and low and high drums. The last swimmers have come in from the beach 
now and are dressing up-stairs; the cars from New York are parked five deep in 
the drive, and already the halls and salons and verandas are gaudy with primary 
colors, and hair shorn in strange new ways, and shawls beyond the dreams of 
Castile. The bar is in full swing, and floating rounds of cocktails permeate the 
garden outside, until the air is alive with chatter and laughter, and casual 
innuendo and introductions forgotten on the spot, and enthusiastic meetings 
between women who never knew each otherÅfs names.
The lights grow brighter as the earth lurches away from the sun, and now the 
orchestra is playing yellow cocktail music, and the opera of voices pitches a 
key higher. Laughter is easier minute by minute, spilled with prodigality, 
tipped out at a cheerful word. The groups change more swiftly, swell with new 
arrivals, dissolve and form in the same breath; already there are wanderers, 
confident girls who weave here and there among the stouter and more stable, 
become for a sharp, joyous moment the centre of a group, and then, excited with 
triumph, glide on through the sea-change of faces and voices and color under the 
constantly changing light.
Suddenly one of the gypsies, in trembling opal, seizes a cocktail out of the 
air, dumps it down for courage and, moving her hands like Frisco, dances out 
alone on the canvas platform. A momentary hush; the orchestra leader varies his 
rhythm obligingly for her, and there is a burst of chatter as the erroneous news 
goes around that she is Gilda GrayÅfs understudy from the FOLLIES. The party has 
begun.
I believe that on the first night I went to GatsbyÅfs house I was one of the few 
guests who had actually been invited. People were not invited&#8212;they went there. 
They got into automobiles which bore them out to Long Island, and somehow they 
ended up at GatsbyÅfs door. Once there they were introduced by somebody who knew 
Gatsby, and after that they conducted themselves according to the rules of 
behavior associated with amusement parks. Sometimes they came and went without 
having met Gatsby at all, came for the party with a simplicity of heart that was 
its own ticket of admission.
I had been actually invited. A chauffeur in a uniform of robinÅfs-egg blue 
crossed my lawn early that Saturday morning with a surprisingly formal note from 
his employer: the honor would be entirely GatsbyÅfs, it said, if I would attend 
his Åglittle party.Åh that night. He had seen me several times, and had intended 
to call on me long before, but a peculiar combination of circumstances had 
prevented it&#8212;signed Jay Gatsby, in a majestic hand.
Dressed up in white flannels I went over to his lawn a little after seven, and 
wandered around rather ill at ease among swirls and eddies of people I didnÅft 
know&#8212;though here and there was a face I had noticed on the commuting train. I 
was immediately struck by the number of young Englishmen dotted about; all well 
dressed, all looking a little hungry, and all talking in low, earnest voices to 
solid and prosperous Americans. I was sure that they were selling something: 
bonds or insurance or automobiles. They were at least agonizingly aware of the 
easy money in the vicinity and convinced that it was theirs for a few words in 
the right key.
As soon as I arrived I made an attempt to find my host, but the two or three 
people of whom I asked his whereabouts stared at me in such an amazed way, and 
denied so vehemently any knowledge of his movements, that I slunk off in the 
direction of the cocktail table&#8212;the only place in the garden where a single man 
could linger without looking purposeless and alone.
I was on my way to get roaring drunk from sheer embarrassment when Jordan Baker 
came out of the house and stood at the head of the marble steps, leaning a 
little backward and looking with contemptuous interest down into the garden.
Welcome or not, I found it necessary to attach myself to some one before I 
should begin to address cordial remarks to the passers-by.
ÅgHello!Åh I roared, advancing toward her. My voice seemed unnaturally loud across 
the garden.
ÅgI thought you might be here,Åh she responded absently as I came up. ÅgI 
remembered you lived next door to&#8212;&#8212;Åh She held my hand impersonally, as a promise 
that sheÅfd take care of me in a minute, and gave ear to two girls in twin yellow 
dresses, who stopped at the foot of the steps.
ÅgHello!Åh they cried together. ÅgSorry you didnÅft win.Åh
That was for the golf tournament. She had lost in the finals the week before.
ÅgYou donÅft know who we are,Åh said one of the girls in yellow, Ågbut we met you 
here about a month ago.Åh
ÅgYouÅfve dyed your hair since then,Åh remarked Jordan, and I started, but the 
girls had moved casually on and her remark was addressed to the premature moon, 
produced like the supper, no doubt, out of a catererÅfs basket. With JordanÅfs 
slender golden arm resting in mine, we descended the steps and sauntered about 
the garden. A tray of cocktails floated at us through the twilight, and we sat 
down at a table with the two girls in yellow and three men, each one introduced 
to us as Mr. Mumble.
ÅgDo you come to these parties often?Åh inquired Jordan of the girl beside her.
ÅgThe last one was the one I met you at,Åh answered the girl, in an alert 
confident voice. She turned to her companion: ÅgWasnÅft it for you, Lucille?Åh
It was for Lucille, too.
ÅgI like to come,Åh Lucille said. ÅgI never care what I do, so I always have a good 
time. When I was here last I tore my gown on a chair, and he asked me my name 
and address&#8212;inside of a week I got a package from CroirierÅfs with a new evening 
gown in it.Åh
ÅgDid you keep it?Åh asked Jordan.
ÅgSure I did. I was going to wear it to-night, but it was too big in the bust and 
had to be altered. It was gas blue with lavender beads. Two hundred and 
sixty-five dollars.Åh
ÅgThereÅfs something funny about a fellow thatÅfll do a thing like that,Åh said the 
other girl eagerly. ÅgHe doesnÅft want any trouble with ANYbody.Åh
ÅgWho doesnÅft?Åh I inquired.
ÅgGatsby. Somebody told me&#8212;&#8212;Åh
The two girls and Jordan leaned together confidentially.
ÅgSomebody told me they thought he killed a man once.Åh
A thrill passed over all of us. The three Mr. Mumbles bent forward and listened 
eagerly.
ÅgI donÅft think itÅfs so much THAT,Åh argued Lucille sceptically; ÅgitÅfs more that 
he was a German spy during the war.Åh
One of the men nodded in confirmation.
ÅgI heard that from a man who knew all about him, grew up with him in Germany,Åh 
he assured us positively.
ÅgOh, no,Åh said the first girl, Ågit couldnÅft be that, because he was in the 
American army during the war.Åh As our credulity switched back to her she leaned 
forward with enthusiasm. ÅgYou look at him sometimes when he thinks nobodyÅfs 
looking at him. IÅfll bet he killed a man.Åh
She narrowed her eyes and shivered. Lucille shivered. We all turned and looked 
around for Gatsby. It was testimony to the romantic speculation he inspired that 
there were whispers about him from those who found little that it was necessary 
to whisper about in this world.
The first supper&#8212;there would be another one after midnight&#8212;was now being served, 
and Jordan invited me to join her own party, who were spread around a table on 
the other side of the garden. There were three married couples and JordanÅfs 
escort, a persistent undergraduate given to violent innuendo, and obviously 
under the impression that sooner or later Jordan was going to yield him up her 
person to a greater or lesser degree. Instead of rambling, this party had 
preserved a dignified homogeneity, and assumed to itself the function of 
representing the staid nobility of the country-side&#8212;East Egg condescending to 
West Egg, and carefully on guard against its spectroscopic gayety.
ÅgLetÅfs get out,Åh whispered Jordan, after a somehow wasteful and inappropriate 
half-hour. ÅgThis is much too polite for me.Åh
We got up, and she explained that we were going to find the host: I had never 
met him, she said, and it was making me uneasy. The undergraduate nodded in a 
cynical, melancholy way.
The bar, where we glanced first, was crowded, but Gatsby was not there. She 
couldnÅft find him from the top of the steps, and he wasnÅft on the veranda. On a 
chance we tried an important-looking door, and walked into a high Gothic 
library, panelled with carved English oak, and probably transported complete 
from some ruin overseas.
A stout, middle-aged man, with enormous owl-eyed spectacles, was sitting 
somewhat drunk on the edge of a great table, staring with unsteady concentration 
at the shelves of books. As we entered he wheeled excitedly around and examined 
Jordan from head to foot.
ÅgWhat do you think?Åh he demanded impetuously.
ÅgAbout what?Åh He waved his hand toward the book-shelves.
ÅgAbout that. As a matter of fact you neednÅft bother to ascertain. I ascertained. 
TheyÅfre real.Åh
ÅgThe books?Åh
He nodded.
ÅgAbsolutely real&#8212;have pages and everything. I thought theyÅfd be a nice durable 
cardboard. Matter of fact, theyÅfre absolutely real. Pages and&#8212;Here! Lemme show 
you.Åh
Taking our scepticism for granted, he rushed to the bookcases and returned with 
Volume One of the ÅgStoddard Lectures.Åh
ÅgSee!Åh he cried triumphantly. ÅgItÅfs a bona-fide piece of printed matter. It 
fooled me. This fellaÅfs a regular Belasco. ItÅfs a triumph. What thoroughness! 
What realism! Knew when to stop, too&#8212;didnÅft cut the pages. But what do you want? 
What do you expect?Åh
He snatched the book from me and replaced it hastily on its shelf, muttering 
that if one brick was removed the whole library was liable to collapse.
ÅgWho brought you?Åh he demanded. ÅgOr did you just come? I was brought. Most 
people were brought.Åh
Jordan looked at him alertly, cheerfully, without answering.
ÅgI was brought by a woman named Roosevelt,Åh he continued. ÅgMrs. Claud Roosevelt. 
Do you know her? I met her somewhere last night. IÅfve been drunk for about a 
week now, and I thought it might sober me up to sit in a library.Åh
ÅgHas it?Åh
ÅgA little bit, I think. I canÅft tell yet. IÅfve only been here an hour. Did I 
tell you about the books? TheyÅfre real. TheyÅfre&#8212;&#8212;Åh
ÅgYou told us.Åh We shook hands with him gravely and went back outdoors.
There was dancing now on the canvas in the garden; old men pushing young girls 
backward in eternal graceless circles, superior couples holding each other 
tortuously, fashionably, and keeping in the corners&#8212;and a great number of single 
girls dancing individualistically or relieving the orchestra for a moment of the 
burden of the banjo or the traps. By midnight the hilarity had increased. A 
celebrated tenor had sung in Italian, and a notorious contralto had sung in 
jazz, and between the numbers people were doing Ågstunts.Åh all over the garden, 
while happy, vacuous bursts of laughter rose toward the summer sky. A pair of 
stage twins, who turned out to be the girls in yellow, did a baby act in 
costume, and champagne was served in glasses bigger than finger-bowls. The moon 
had risen higher, and floating in the Sound was a triangle of silver scales, 
trembling a little to the stiff, tinny drip of the banjoes on the lawn.
I was still with Jordan Baker. We were sitting at a table with a man of about my 
age and a rowdy little girl, who gave way upon the slightest provocation to 
uncontrollable laughter. I was enjoying myself now. I had taken two finger-bowls 
of champagne, and the scene had changed before my eyes into something 
significant, elemental, and profound.
At a lull in the entertainment the man looked at me and smiled.
ÅgYour face is familiar,Åh he said, politely. ÅgWerenÅft you in the Third Division 
during the war?Åh
ÅgWhy, yes. I was in the Ninth Machine-gun Battalion.Åh
ÅgI was in the Seventh Infantry until June nineteen-eighteen. I knew IÅfd seen you 
somewhere before.Åh
We talked for a moment about some wet, gray little villages in France. Evidently 
he lived in this vicinity, for he told me that he had just bought a hydroplane, 
and was going to try it out in the morning.
ÅgWant to go with me, old sport? Just near the shore along the Sound.Åh
ÅgWhat time?Åh
ÅgAny time that suits you best.Åh
It was on the tip of my tongue to ask his name when Jordan looked around and 
smiled.
ÅgHaving a gay time now?Åh she inquired.
ÅgMuch better.Åh I turned again to my new acquaintance. ÅgThis is an unusual party 
for me. I havenÅft even seen the host. I live over there&#8212;&#8212;Åh I waved my hand at 
the invisible hedge in the distance, Ågand this man Gatsby sent over his 
chauffeur with an invitation.Åh For a moment he looked at me as if he failed to 
understand.
ÅgIÅfm Gatsby,Åh he said suddenly.
ÅgWhat!Åh I exclaimed. ÅgOh, I beg your pardon.Åh
ÅgI thought you knew, old sport. IÅfm afraid IÅfm not a very good host.Åh
He smiled understandingly&#8212;much more than understandingly. It was one of those 
rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it, that you may come 
across four or five times in life. It faced&#8212;or seemed to face&#8212;the whole external 
world for an instant, and then concentrated on you with an irresistible 
prejudice in your favor. It understood you just so far as you wanted to be 
understood, believed in you as you would like to believe in yourself, and 
assured you that it had precisely the impression of you that, at your best, you 
hoped to convey. Precisely at that point it vanished&#8212;and I was looking at an 
elegant young rough-neck, a year or two over thirty, whose elaborate formality 
of speech just missed being absurd. Some time before he introduced himself IÅfd 
got a strong impression that he was picking his words with care.
Almost at the moment when Mr. Gatsby identified himself, a butler hurried toward 
him with the information that Chicago was calling him on the wire. He excused 
himself with a small bow that included each of us in turn.
ÅgIf you want anything just ask for it, old sport,Åh he urged me. ÅgExcuse me. I 
will rejoin you later.Åh
When he was gone I turned immediately to Jordan&#8212;constrained to assure her of my 
surprise. I had expected that Mr. Gatsby would be a florid and corpulent person 
in his middle years.
ÅgWho is he?Åh I demanded.
ÅgDo you know?Åh
ÅgHeÅfs just a man named Gatsby.Åh
ÅgWhere is he from, I mean? And what does he do?Åh
ÅgNow YOUÅfRE started on the subject,Åh she answered with a wan smile. ÅgWell, he 
told me once he was an Oxford man.Åh A dim background started to take shape 
behind him, but at her next remark it faded away.
ÅgHowever, I donÅft believe it.Åh
ÅgWhy not?Åh ÅgI donÅft know,Åh she insisted, ÅgI just donÅft think he went there.Åh
Something in her tone reminded me of the other girlÅfs ÅgI think he killed a man,Åh 
and had the effect of stimulating my curiosity. I would have accepted without 
question the information that Gatsby sprang from the swamps of Louisiana or from 
the lower East Side of New York. That was comprehensible. But young men 
didnÅft&#8212;at least in my provincial inexperience I believed they didnÅft&#8212;drift 
coolly out of nowhere and buy a palace on Long Island Sound.
ÅgAnyhow, he gives large parties,Åh said Jordan, changing the subject with an 
urbane distaste for the concrete. ÅgAnd I like large parties. TheyÅfre so 
intimate. At small parties there isnÅft any privacy.Åh
There was the boom of a bass drum, and the voice of the orchestra leader rang 
out suddenly above the echolalia of the garden.
ÅgLadies and gentlemen,Åh he cried. ÅgAt the request of Mr. Gatsby we are going to 
play for you Mr. Vladimir TostoffÅfs latest work, which attracted so much 
attention at Carnegie Hall last May. If you read the papers, you know there was 
a big sensation.Åh He smiled with jovial condescension, and added: ÅgSome 
sensation!Åh Whereupon everybody laughed.
ÅgThe piece is known,Åh he concluded lustily, Ågas Vladimir TostoffÅfs JAZZ HISTORY 
OF THE WORLD.Åh
The nature of Mr. TostoffÅfs composition eluded me, because just as it began my 
eyes fell on Gatsby, standing alone on the marble steps and looking from one 
group to another with approving eyes. His tanned skin was drawn attractively 
tight on his face and his short hair looked as though it were trimmed every day. 
I could see nothing sinister about him. I wondered if the fact that he was not 
drinking helped to set him off from his guests, for it seemed to me that he grew 
more correct as the fraternal hilarity increased. When the JAZZ HISTORY OF THE 
WORLD was over, girls were putting their heads on menÅfs shoulders in a puppyish, 
convivial way, girls were swooning backward playfully into menÅfs arms, even into 
groups, knowing that some one would arrest their falls&#8212;but no one swooned 
backward on Gatsby, and no French bob touched GatsbyÅfs shoulder, and no singing 
quartets were formed with GatsbyÅfs head for one link.
ÅgI beg your pardon.Åh
GatsbyÅfs butler was suddenly standing beside us.
ÅgMiss Baker?Åh he inquired. ÅgI beg your pardon, but Mr. Gatsby would like to 
speak to you alone.Åh
ÅgWith me?Åh she exclaimed in surprise.
ÅgYes, madame.Åh
She got up slowly, raising her eyebrows at me in astonishment, and followed the 
butler toward the house. I noticed that she wore her evening-dress, all her 
dresses, like sports clothes&#8212;there was a jauntiness about her movements as if 
she had first learned to walk upon golf courses on clean, crisp mornings.
I was alone and it was almost two. For some time confused and intriguing sounds 
had issued from a long, many-windowed room which overhung the terrace. Eluding 
JordanÅfs undergraduate, who was now engaged in an obstetrical conversation with 
two chorus girls, and who implored me to join him, I went inside.
The large room was full of people. One of the girls in yellow was playing the 
piano, and beside her stood a tall, red-haired young lady from a famous chorus, 
engaged in song. She had drunk a quantity of champagne, and during the course of 
her song she had decided, ineptly, that everything was very, very sad&#8212;she was 
not only singing, she was weeping too. Whenever there was a pause in the song 
she filled it with gasping, broken sobs, and then took up the lyric again in a 
quavering soprano. The tears coursed down her cheeks&#8212;not freely, however, for 
when they came into contact with her heavily beaded eyelashes they assumed an 
inky color, and pursued the rest of their way in slow black rivulets. A humorous 
suggestion was made that she sing the notes on her face, whereupon she threw up 
her hands, sank into a chair, and went off into a deep vinous sleep.
ÅgShe had a fight with a man who says heÅfs her husband,Åh explained a girl at my 
elbow.
I looked around. Most of the remaining women were now having fights with men 
said to be their husbands. Even JordanÅfs party, the quartet from East Egg, were 
rent asunder by dissension. One of the men was talking with curious intensity to 
a young actress, and his wife, after attempting to laugh at the situation in a 
dignified and indifferent way, broke down entirely and resorted to flank 
attacks&#8212;at intervals she appeared suddenly at his side like an angry diamond, 
and hissed: ÅgYou promised!Åh into his ear.
The reluctance to go home was not confined to wayward men. The hall was at 
present occupied by two deplorably sober men and their highly indignant wives. 
The wives were sympathizing with each other in slightly raised voices.
ÅgWhenever he sees IÅfm having a good time he wants to go home.Åh
ÅgNever heard anything so selfish in my life.Åh
ÅgWeÅfre always the first ones to leave.Åh
ÅgSo are we.Åh
ÅgWell, weÅfre almost the last to-night,Åh said one of the men sheepishly. ÅgThe 
orchestra left half an hour ago.Åh
In spite of the wivesÅf agreement that such malevolence was beyond credibility, 
the dispute ended in a short struggle, and both wives were lifted, kicking, into 
the night.
As I waited for my hat in the hall the door of the library opened and Jordan 
Baker and Gatsby came out together. He was saying some last word to her, but the 
eagerness in his manner tightened abruptly into formality as several people 
approached him to say good-bye.
JordanÅfs party were calling impatiently to her from the porch, but she lingered 
for a moment to shake hands.
ÅgIÅfve just heard the most amazing thing,Åh she whispered. ÅgHow long were we in 
there?Åh
ÅgWhy, about an hour.Åh ÅgIt was&#8212;simply amazing,Åh she repeated abstractedly. ÅgBut I 
swore I wouldnÅft tell it and here I am tantalizing you.Åh She yawned gracefully 
in my face: ÅgPlease come and see me. . . . Phone book . . . Under the name of 
Mrs. Sigourney Howard . . . My aunt . . .Åh She was hurrying off as she 
talked&#8212;her brown hand waved a jaunty salute as she melted into her party at the 
door.
Rather ashamed that on my first appearance I had stayed so late, I joined the 
last of GatsbyÅfs guests, who were clustered around him. I wanted to explain that 
IÅfd hunted for him early in the evening and to apologize for not having known 
him in the garden.
ÅgDonÅft mention it,Åh he enjoined me eagerly. ÅgDonÅft give it another thought, old 
sport.Åh The familiar expression held no more familiarity than the hand which 
reassuringly brushed my shoulder. ÅgAnd donÅft forget weÅfre going up in the 
hydroplane to-morrow morning, at nine oÅfclock.Åh
Then the butler, behind his shoulder: ÅgPhiladelphia wants you on the Åephone, 
sir.Åh
ÅgAll right, in a minute. Tell them IÅfll be right there. . . . good night.Åh
ÅgGood night.Åh
ÅgGood night.Åh He smiled&#8212;and suddenly there seemed to be a pleasant significance 
in having been among the last to go, as if he had desired it all the time. ÅgGood 
night, old sport. . . . good night.Åh
But as I walked down the steps I saw that the evening was not quite over. Fifty 
feet from the door a dozen headlights illuminated a bizarre and tumultuous 
scene. In the ditch beside the road, right side up, but violently shorn of one 
wheel, rested a new coupe which had left GatsbyÅfs drive not two minutes before. 
The sharp jut of a wall accounted for the detachment of the wheel, which was now 
getting considerable attention from half a dozen curious chauffeurs. However, as 
they had left their cars blocking the road, a harsh, discordant din from those 
in the rear had been audible for some time, and added to the already violent 
confusion of the scene.
A man in a long duster had dismounted from the wreck and now stood in the middle 
of the road, looking from the car to the tire and from the tire to the observers 
in a pleasant, puzzled way.
ÅgSee!Åh he explained. ÅgIt went in the ditch.Åh
The fact was infinitely astonishing to him, and I recognized first the unusual 
quality of wonder, and then the man&#8212;it was the late patron of GatsbyÅfs library.
ÅgHowÅfd it happen?Åh
He shrugged his shoulders.
ÅgI know nothing whatever about mechanics,Åh he said decisively.
ÅgBut how did it happen? Did you run into the wall?Åh ÅgDonÅft ask me,Åh said Owl 
Eyes, washing his hands of the whole matter. ÅgI know very little about 
driving&#8212;next to nothing. It happened, and thatÅfs all I know.Åh
ÅgWell, if youÅfre a poor driver you oughtnÅft to try driving at night.Åh
ÅgBut I wasnÅft even trying,Åh he explained indignantly, ÅgI wasnÅft even trying.Åh
An awed hush fell upon the bystanders.
ÅgDo you want to commit suicide?Åh
ÅgYouÅfre lucky it was just a wheel! A bad driver and not even TRYing!Åh
ÅgYou donÅft understand,Åh explained the criminal. ÅgI wasnÅft driving. ThereÅfs 
another man in the car.Åh
The shock that followed this declaration found voice in a sustained ÅgAh-h-h!Åh as 
the door of the coupe swung slowly open. The crowd&#8212;it was now a crowd&#8212;stepped 
back involuntarily, and when the door had opened wide there was a ghostly pause. 
Then, very gradually, part by part, a pale, dangling individual stepped out of 
the wreck, pawing tentatively at the ground with a large uncertain dancing shoe.
Blinded by the glare of the headlights and confused by the incessant groaning of 
the horns, the apparition stood swaying for a moment before he perceived the man 
in the duster.
ÅgWhaÅfs matter?Åh he inquired calmly. ÅgDid we run outa gas?Åh
ÅgLook!Åh
Half a dozen fingers pointed at the amputated wheel&#8212;he stared at it for a 
moment, and then looked upward as though he suspected that it had dropped from 
the sky.
ÅgIt came off,Åh some one explained.
He nodded.
ÅgAt first I dinÅf notice weÅfd stopped.Åh
A pause. Then, taking a long breath and straightening his shoulders, he remarked 
in a determined voice:
ÅgWonderÅfff tell me where thereÅfs a gasÅfline station?Åh
At least a dozen men, some of them little better off than he was, explained to 
him that wheel and car were no longer joined by any physical bond.
ÅgBack out,Åh he suggested after a moment. ÅgPut her in reverse.Åh
ÅgBut the WHEELÅfS off!Åh
He hesitated.
ÅgNo harm in trying,Åh he said.
The caterwauling horns had reached a crescendo and I turned away and cut across 
the lawn toward home. I glanced back once. A wafer of a moon was shining over 
GatsbyÅfs house, making the night fine as before, and surviving the laughter and 
the sound of his still glowing garden. A sudden emptiness seemed to flow now 
from the windows and the great doors, endowing with complete isolation the 
figure of the host, who stood on the porch, his hand up in a formal gesture of 
farewell.
Reading over what I have written so far, I see I have given the impression that 
the events of three nights several weeks apart were all that absorbed me. On the 
contrary, they were merely casual events in a crowded summer, and, until much 
later, they absorbed me infinitely less than my personal affairs.
Most of the time I worked. In the early morning the sun threw my shadow westward 
as I hurried down the white chasms of lower New York to the Probity Trust. I 
knew the other clerks and young bond-salesmen by their first names, and lunched 
with them in dark, crowded restaurants on little pig sausages and mashed 
potatoes and coffee. I even had a short affair with a girl who lived in Jersey 
City and worked in the accounting department, but her brother began throwing 
mean looks in my direction, so when she went on her vacation in July I let it 
blow quietly away.
I took dinner usually at the Yale Club&#8212;for some reason it was the gloomiest 
event of my day&#8212;and then I went up-stairs to the library and studied investments 
and securities for a conscientious hour. There were generally a few rioters 
around, but they never came into the library, so it was a good place to work. 
After that, if the night was mellow, I strolled down Madison Avenue past the old 
Murray Hill Hotel, and over 33rd Street to the Pennsylvania Station.
I began to like New York, the racy, adventurous feel of it at night, and the 
satisfaction that the constant flicker of men and women and machines gives to 
the restless eye. I liked to walk up Fifth Avenue and pick out romantic women 
from the crowd and imagine that in a few minutes I was going to enter into their 
lives, and no one would ever know or disapprove. Sometimes, in my mind, I 
followed them to their apartments on the corners of hidden streets, and they 
turned and smiled back at me before they faded through a door into warm 
darkness. At the enchanted metropolitan twilight I felt a haunting loneliness 
sometimes, and felt it in others&#8212;poor young clerks who loitered in front of 
windows waiting until it was time for a solitary restaurant dinner&#8212;young clerks 
in the dusk, wasting the most poignant moments of night and life.
Again at eight oÅfclock, when the dark lanes of the Forties were five deep with 
throbbing taxi-cabs, bound for the theatre district, I felt a sinking in my 
heart. Forms leaned together in the taxis as they waited, and voices sang, and 
there was laughter from unheard jokes, and lighted cigarettes outlined 
unintelligible 70 gestures inside. Imagining that I, too, was hurrying toward 
gayety and sharing their intimate excitement, I wished them well.
For a while I lost sight of Jordan Baker, and then in midsummer I found her 
again. At first I was flattered to go places with her, because she was a golf 
champion, and every one knew her name. Then it was something more. I wasnÅft 
actually in love, but I felt a sort of tender curiosity. The bored haughty face 
that she turned to the world concealed something&#8212;most affectations conceal 
something eventually, even though they donÅft in the beginning&#8212;and one day I 
found what it was. When we were on a house-party together up in Warwick, she 
left a borrowed car out in the rain with the top down, and then lied about 
it&#8212;and suddenly I remembered the story about her that had eluded me that night 
at DaisyÅfs. At her first big golf tournament there was a row that nearly reached 
the newspapers&#8212;a suggestion that she had moved her ball from a bad lie in the 
semi-final round. The thing approached the proportions of a scandal&#8212;then died 
away. A caddy retracted his statement, and the only other witness admitted that 
he might have been mistaken. The incident and the name had remained together in 
my mind.
Jordan Baker instinctively avoided clever, shrewd men, and now I saw that this 
was because she felt safer on a plane where any divergence from a code would be 
thought impossible. She was incurably dishonest. She wasnÅft able to endure being 
at a disadvantage and, given this unwillingness, I suppose she had begun dealing 
in subterfuges when she was very young in order to keep that cool, insolent 
smile turned to the world and yet satisfy the demands of her hard, jaunty body.
It made no difference to me. Dishonesty in a woman is a thing you never blame 
deeply&#8212;I was casually sorry, and then I forgot. It was on that same house party 
that we had a curious conversation about driving a car. It started because she 
passed so close to some workmen that our fender flicked a button on one manÅfs 
coat.
ÅgYouÅfre a rotten driver,Åh I protested. ÅgEither you ought to be more careful, or 
you oughtnÅft to drive at all.Åh
ÅgI am careful.Åh
ÅgNo, youÅfre not.Åh
ÅgWell, other people are,Åh she said lightly.
ÅgWhatÅfs that got to do with it?Åh
ÅgTheyÅfll keep out of my way,Åh she insisted. ÅgIt takes two to make an accident.Åh
ÅgSuppose you met somebody just as careless as yourself.Åh
ÅgI hope I never will,Åh she answered. ÅgI hate careless people. ThatÅfs why I like 
you.Åh
Her gray, sun-strained eyes stared straight ahead, but she had deliberately 
shifted our relations, and for a moment I thought I loved her. But I am 
slow-thinking and full of interior rules that act as brakes on my desires, and I 
knew that first I had to get myself definitely out of that tangle back home. IÅfd 
been writing letters once a week and signing them: ÅgLove, Nick,Åh and all I could 
think of was how, when that certain girl played tennis, a faint mustache of 
perspiration appeared on her upper lip. Nevertheless there was a vague 
understanding that had to be tactfully broken off before I was free.
Every one suspects himself of at least one of the cardinal virtues, and this is 
mine: I am one of the few honest people that I have ever known.
Chapter 4
On Sunday morning while church bells rang in the villages alongshore, the world 
and its mistress returned to GatsbyÅfs house and twinkled hilariously on his 
lawn.
ÅgHeÅfs a bootlegger,Åh said the young ladies, moving somewhere between his 
cocktails and his flowers. ÅgOne time he killed a man who had found out that he 
was nephew to Von Hindenburg and second cousin to the devil. Reach me a rose, 
honey, and pour me a last drop into that there crystal glass.Åh
Once I wrote down on the empty spaces of a time-table the names of those who 
came to GatsbyÅfs house that summer. It is an old time-table now, disintegrating 
at its folds, and headed ÅgThis schedule in effect July 5th, 1922.Åh But I can 
still read the gray names, and they will give you a better impression than my 
generalities of those who accepted GatsbyÅfs hospitality and paid him the subtle 
tribute of knowing nothing whatever about him.
From East Egg, then, came the Chester Beckers and the Leeches, and a man named 
Bunsen, whom I knew at Yale, and Doctor Webster Civet, who was drowned last 
summer up in Maine. And the Hornbeams and the Willie Voltaires, and a whole clan 
named Blackbuck, who always gathered in a corner and flipped up their noses like 
goats at whosoever came near. And the Ismays and the Chrysties (or rather Hubert 
Auerbach and Mr. ChrystieÅfs wife), and Edgar Beaver, whose hair, they say, 
turned cotton-white one winter afternoon for no good reason at all.
Clarence Endive was from East Egg, as I remember. He came only once, in white 
knickerbockers, and had a fight with a bum named Etty in the garden. From 
farther out on the Island came the Cheadles and the O. R. P. Schraeders, and the 
Stonewall Jackson Abrams of Georgia, and the Fishguards and the Ripley Snells. 
Snell was there three days before he went to the penitentiary, so drunk out on 
the gravel drive that Mrs. Ulysses SwettÅfs automobile ran over his right hand. 
The Dancies came, too, and S. B. Whitebait, who was well over sixty, and Maurice 
A. Flink, and the Hammerheads, and Beluga the tobacco importer, and BelugaÅfs 
girls.
From West Egg came the Poles and the Mulreadys and Cecil Roebuck and Cecil 
Schoen and Gulick the state senator and Newton Orchid, who controlled Films Par 
Excellence, and Eckhaust and Clyde Cohen and Don S. Schwartze (the son) and 
Arthur McCarty, all connected with the movies in one way or another. And the 
Catlips and the Bembergs and G. Earl Muldoon, brother to that Muldoon who 
afterward strangled his wife. Da Fontano the promoter came there, and Ed Legros 
and James B. (ÅgRot-Gut.Åh) Ferret and the De Jongs and Ernest Lilly&#8212;they came to 
gamble, and when Ferret wandered into the garden it meant he was cleaned out and 
Associated Traction would have to fluctuate profitably next day.
A man named Klipspringer was there so often and so long that he became known as 
Ågthe boarder.Åh&#8212;I doubt if he had any other home. Of theatrical people there were 
Gus Waize and Horace OÅfdonavan and Lester Meyer and George Duckweed and Francis 
Bull. Also from New York were the Chromes and the Backhyssons and the Dennickers 
and Russel Betty and the Corrigans and the Kellehers and the Dewars and the 
Scullys and S. W. Belcher and the Smirkes and the young Quinns, divorced now, 
and Henry L. Palmetto, who killed himself by jumping in front of a subway train 
in Times Square.
Benny McClenahan arrived always with four girls. They were never quite the same 
ones in physical person, but they were so identical one with another that it 
inevitably seemed they had been there before. I have forgotten their 
names&#8212;Jaqueline, I think, or else Consuela, or Gloria or Judy or June, and their 
last names were either the melodious names of flowers and months or the sterner 
ones of the great American capitalists whose cousins, if pressed, they would 
confess themselves to be.
In addition to all these I can remember that Faustina OÅfbrien came there at 
least once and the Baedeker girls and young Brewer, who had his nose shot off in 
the war, and Mr. Albrucksburger and Miss Haag, his fiancee, and Ardita 
Fitz-Peters and Mr. P. Jewett, once head of the American Legion, and Miss 
Claudia Hip, with a man reputed to be her chauffeur, and a prince of something, 
whom we called Duke, and whose name, if I ever knew it, I have forgotten.
All these people came to GatsbyÅfs house in the summer.
At nine oÅfclock, one morning late in July, GatsbyÅfs gorgeous car lurched up the 
rocky drive to my door and gave out a burst of melody from its three-noted horn. 
It was the first time he had called on me, though I had gone to two of his 
parties, mounted in his hydroplane, and, at his urgent invitation, made frequent 
use of his beach.
ÅgGood morning, old sport. YouÅfre having lunch with me to-day and I thought weÅfd 
ride up together.Åh
He was balancing himself on the dashboard of his car with that resourcefulness 
of movement that is so peculiarly American&#8212;that comes, I suppose, with the 
absence of lifting work or rigid sitting in youth and, even more, with the 
formless grace of our nervous, sporadic games. This quality was continually 
breaking through his punctilious manner in the shape of restlessness. He was 
never quite still; there was always a tapping foot somewhere or the impatient 
opening and closing of a hand.
He saw me looking with admiration at his car.
ÅgItÅfs pretty, isnÅft it, old sport?Åh He jumped off to give me a better view. 
ÅgHavenÅft you ever seen it before?Åh
IÅfd seen it. Everybody had seen it. It was a rich cream color, bright with 
nickel, swollen here and there in its monstrous length with triumphant hat-boxes 
and supper-boxes and tool-boxes, and terraced with a labyrinth of wind-shields 
that mirrored a dozen suns. Sitting down behind many layers of glass in a sort 
of green leather conservatory, we started to town.
I had talked with him perhaps half a dozen times in the past month and found, to 
my disappointment, that he had little to say: So my first impression, that he 
was a person of some undefined consequence, had gradually faded and he had 
become simply the proprietor of an elaborate road-house next door.
And then came that disconcerting ride. We hadnÅft reached West Egg village before 
Gatsby began leaving his elegant sentences unfinished and slapping himself 
indecisively on the knee of his caramel-colored suit.
ÅgLook here, old sport,Åh he broke out surprisingly. ÅgWhatÅfs your opinion of me, 
anyhow?Åh A little overwhelmed, I began the generalized evasions which that 
question deserves.
ÅgWell, IÅfm going to tell you something about my life,Åh he interrupted. ÅgI donÅft 
want you to get a wrong idea of me from all these stories you hear.Åh
So he was aware of the bizarre accusations that flavored conversation in his 
halls.
ÅgIÅfll tell you GodÅfs truth.Åh His right hand suddenly ordered divine retribution 
to stand by. ÅgI am the son of some wealthy people in the Middle West&#8212;all dead 
now. I was brought up in America but educated at Oxford, because all my 
ancestors have been educated there for many years. It is a family tradition.Åh
He looked at me sideways&#8212;and I knew why Jordan Baker had believed he was lying. 
He hurried the phrase Ågeducated at Oxford,Åh or swallowed it, or choked on it, as 
though it had bothered him before. And with this doubt, his whole statement fell 
to pieces, and I wondered if there wasnÅft something a little sinister about him, 
after all.
ÅgWhat part of the Middle West?Åh I inquired casually.
ÅgSan Francisco.Åh
ÅgI see.Åh
ÅgMy family all died and I came into a good deal of money.Åh
His voice was solemn, as if the memory of that sudden extinction of a clan still 
haunted him. For a moment I suspected that he was pulling my leg, but a glance 
at him convinced me otherwise.
ÅgAfter that I lived like a young rajah in all the capitals of Europe&#8212;Paris, 
Venice, Rome&#8212;collecting jewels, chiefly rubies, hunting big game, painting a 
little, things for myself only, and trying to forget something very sad that had 
happened to me long ago.Åh
With an effort I managed to restrain my incredulous laughter. The very phrases 
were worn so threadbare that they evoked no image except that of a turbaned 
Ågcharacter.Åh leaking sawdust at every pore as he pursued a tiger through the 
Bois de Boulogne.
ÅgThen came the war, old sport. It was a great relief, and I tried very hard to 
die, but I seemed to bear an enchanted life. I accepted a commission as first 
lieutenant when it began. In the Argonne Forest I took two machine-gun 
detachments so far forward that there was a half mile gap on either side of us 
where the infantry couldnÅft advance. We stayed there two days and two nights, a 
hundred and thirty men with sixteen Lewis guns, and when the infantry came up at 
last they found the insignia of three German divisions among the piles of dead. 
I was promoted to be a major, and every Allied government gave me a 
decoration&#8212;even Montenegro, little Montenegro down on the Adriatic Sea!Åh
Little Montenegro! He lifted up the words and nodded at them&#8212;with his smile. The 
smile comprehended MontenegroÅfs troubled history and sympathized with the brave 
struggles of the Montenegrin people. It appreciated fully the chain of national 
circumstances which had elicited this tribute from MontenegroÅfs warm little 
heart. My incredulity was submerged in fascination now; it was like skimming 
hastily through a dozen magazines.
He reached in his pocket, and a piece of metal, slung on a ribbon, fell into my 
palm.
ÅgThatÅfs the one from Montenegro.Åh
To my astonishment, the thing had an authentic look.
ÅgOrderi di Danilo,Åh ran the circular legend, ÅgMontenegro, Nicolas Rex.Åh
ÅgTurn it.Åh
ÅgMajor Jay Gatsby,Åh I read, ÅgFor Valour Extraordinary.Åh
ÅgHereÅfs another thing I always carry. A souvenir of Oxford days. It was taken in 
Trinity Quad&#8212;the man on my left is now the Earl of Dorcaster.Åh
It was a photograph of half a dozen young men in blazers loafing in an archway 
through which were visible a host of spires. There was Gatsby, looking a little, 
not much, younger&#8212;with a cricket bat in his hand.
Then it was all true. I saw the skins of tigers flaming in his palace on the 
Grand Canal; I saw him opening a chest of rubies to ease, with their 
crimson-lighted depths, the gnawings of his broken heart.
ÅgIÅfm going to make a big request of you to-day,Åh he said, pocketing his 
souvenirs with satisfaction, Ågso I thought you ought to know something about me. 
I didnÅft want you to think I was just some nobody. You see, I usually find 
myself among strangers because I drift here and there trying to forget the sad 
thing that happened to me.Åh He hesitated. ÅgYouÅfll hear about it this afternoon.Åh
ÅgAt lunch?Åh
ÅgNo, this afternoon. I happened to find out that youÅfre taking Miss Baker to 
tea.Åh
ÅgDo you mean youÅfre in love with Miss Baker?Åh
ÅgNo, old sport, IÅfm not. But Miss Baker has kindly consented to speak to you 
about this matter.Åh
I hadnÅft the faintest idea what Ågthis matter.Åh was, but I was more annoyed than 
interested. I hadnÅft asked Jordan to tea in order to discuss Mr. Jay Gatsby. I 
was sure the request would be something utterly fantastic, and for a moment I 
was sorry IÅfd ever set foot upon his overpopulated lawn.
He wouldnÅft say another word. His correctness grew on him as we neared the city. 
We passed Port Roosevelt, where there was a glimpse of red-belted ocean-going 
ships, and sped along a cobbled slum lined with the dark, undeserted saloons of 
the faded-gilt nineteen-hundreds. Then the valley of ashes opened out on both 
sides of us, and I had a glimpse of Mrs. Wilson straining at the garage pump 
with panting vitality as we went by.
With fenders spread like wings we scattered light through half Long Island 
City&#8212;only half, for as we twisted among the pillars of the elevated I heard the 
familiar Ågjug&#8212;jug&#8212;SPAT!Åh of a motorcycle, and a frantic policeman rode 
alongside.
ÅgAll right, old sport,Åh called Gatsby. We slowed down. Taking a white card from 
his wallet, he waved it before the manÅfs eyes.
ÅgRight you are,Åh agreed the policeman, tipping his cap. ÅgKnow you next time, Mr. 
Gatsby. Excuse ME!Åh
ÅgWhat was that?Åh I inquired.
ÅgThe picture of Oxford?Åh
ÅgI was able to do the commissioner a favor once, and he sends me a Christmas 
card every year.Åh
Over the great bridge, with the sunlight through the girders making a constant 
flicker upon the moving cars, with the city rising up across the river in white 
heaps and sugar lumps all built with a wish out of non-olfactory money. The city 
seen from the Queensboro Bridge is always the city seen for the first time, in 
its first wild promise of all the mystery and the beauty in the world.
A dead man passed us in a hearse heaped with blooms, followed by two carriages 
with drawn blinds, and by more cheerful carriages for friends. The friends 
looked out at us with the tragic eyes and short upper lips of southeastern 
Europe, and I was glad that the sight of GatsbyÅfs splendid car was included in 
their sombre holiday. As we crossed BlackwellÅfs Island a limousine passed us, 
driven by a white chauffeur, in which sat three modish negroes, two bucks and a 
girl. I laughed aloud as the yolks of their eyeballs rolled toward us in haughty 
rivalry.
ÅgAnything can happen now that weÅfve slid over this bridge,Åh I thought; Åganything 
at all. . . .Åh
Even Gatsby could happen, without any particular wonder.
Roaring noon. In a well&#8212;fanned Forty-second Street cellar I met Gatsby for 
lunch. Blinking away the brightness of the street outside, my eyes picked him 
out obscurely in the anteroom, talking to another man.
ÅgMr. Carraway, this is my friend Mr. Wolfshiem.Åh
A small, flat-nosed Jew raised his large head and regarded me with two fine 
growths of hair which luxuriated in either nostril. After a moment I discovered 
his tiny eyes in the half-darkness.
Åg&#8212;So I took one look at him,Åh said Mr. Wolfshiem, shaking my hand earnestly, 
Ågand what do you think I did?Åh
ÅgWhat?Åh I inquired politely.
But evidently he was not addressing me, for he dropped my hand and covered 
Gatsby with his expressive nose.
ÅgI handed the money to Katspaugh and I sid: Åeall right, Katspaugh, donÅft pay him 
a penny till he shuts his mouth.Åf He shut it then and there.Åh
Gatsby took an arm of each of us and moved forward into the restaurant, 
whereupon Mr. Wolfshiem swallowed a new sentence he was starting and lapsed into 
a somnambulatory abstraction.
ÅgHighballs?Åh asked the head waiter.
ÅgThis is a nice restaurant here,Åh said Mr. Wolfshiem, looking at the 
Presbyterian nymphs on the ceiling. ÅgBut I like across the street better!Åh
ÅgYes, highballs,Åh agreed Gatsby, and then to Mr. Wolfshiem: ÅgItÅfs too hot over 
there.Åh
ÅgHot and small&#8212;yes,Åh said Mr. Wolfshiem, Ågbut full of memories.Åh
ÅgWhat place is that?Åh I asked.
ÅgThe old Metropole.
ÅgThe old Metropole,Åh brooded Mr. Wolfshiem gloomily. ÅgFilled with faces dead and 
gone. Filled with friends gone now forever. I canÅft forget so long as I live the 
night they shot Rosy Rosenthal there. It was six of us at the table, and Rosy 
had eat and drunk a lot all evening. When it was almost morning the waiter came 
up to him with a funny look and says somebody wants to speak to him outside. 
Åeall right,Åf says Rosy, and begins to get up, and I pulled him down in his 
chair.
ÅgÅeLet the bastards come in here if they want you, Rosy, but donÅft you, so help 
me, move outside this room.Åf
ÅgIt was four oÅfclock in the morning then, and if weÅfd of raised the blinds weÅfd 
of seen daylight.Åh
ÅgDid he go?Åh I asked innocently.
ÅgSure he went.Åh Mr. WolfshiemÅfs nose flashed at me indignantly. ÅgHe turned 
around in the door and says: ÅeDonÅft let that waiter take away my coffee!Åf Then 
he went out on the sidewalk, and they shot him three times in his full belly and 
drove away.Åh
ÅgFour of them were electrocuted,Åh I said, remembering.
ÅgFive, with Becker.Åh His nostrils turned to me in an interested way. ÅgI 
understand youÅfre looking for a business gonnegtion.Åh
The juxtaposition of these two remarks was startling. Gatsby answered for me:
ÅgOh, no,Åh he exclaimed, Ågthis isnÅft the man.Åh
ÅgNo?Åh Mr. Wolfshiem seemed disappointed.
ÅgThis is just a friend. I told you weÅfd talk about that some other time.Åh
ÅgI beg your pardon,Åh said Mr. Wolfshiem, ÅgI had a wrong man.Åh
A succulent hash arrived, and Mr. Wolfshiem, forgetting the more sentimental 
atmosphere of the old Metropole, began to eat with ferocious delicacy. His eyes, 
meanwhile, roved very slowly all around the room&#8212;he completed the arc by turning 
to inspect the people directly behind. I think that, except for my presence, he 
would have taken one short glance beneath our own table.
ÅgLook here, old sport,Åh said Gatsby, leaning toward me, ÅgIÅfm afraid I made you a 
little angry this morning in the car.Åh
There was the smile again, but this time I held out against it.
ÅgI donÅft like mysteries,Åh I answered. ÅgAnd I donÅft understand why you wonÅft come 
out frankly and tell me what you want. Why has it all got to come through Miss 
Baker?Åh
ÅgOh, itÅfs nothing underhand,Åh he assured me. ÅgMiss BakerÅfs a great sportswoman, 
you know, and sheÅfd never do anything that wasnÅft all right.Åh
Suddenly he looked at his watch, jumped up, and hurried from the room, leaving 
me with Mr. Wolfshiem at the table.
ÅgHe has to telephone,Åh said Mr. Wolfshiem, following him with his eyes. ÅgFine 
fellow, isnÅft he? Handsome to look at and a perfect gentleman.Åh
ÅgYes.Åh
ÅgHeÅfs an Oggsford man.Åh
ÅgOh!Åh
ÅgHe went to Oggsford College in England. You know Oggsford College?Åh
ÅgIÅfve heard of it.Åh
ÅgItÅfs one of the most famous colleges in the world.Åh
ÅgHave you known Gatsby for a long time?Åh I inquired.
ÅgSeveral years,Åh he answered in a gratified way. ÅgI made the pleasure of his 
acquaintance just after the war. But I knew I had discovered a man of fine 
breeding after I talked with him an hour. I said to myself: ÅeThereÅfs the kind of 
man youÅfd like to take home and introduce to your mother and sister.Åf.Åh He 
paused. ÅgI see youÅfre looking at my cuff buttons.Åh I hadnÅft been looking at 
them, but I did now.
They were composed of oddly familiar pieces of ivory.
ÅgFinest specimens of human molars,Åh he informed me.
ÅgWell!Åh I inspected them. ÅgThatÅfs a very interesting idea.Åh
ÅgYeah.Åh He flipped his sleeves up under his coat. ÅgYeah, GatsbyÅfs very careful 
about women. He would never so much as look at a friendÅfs wife.Åh
When the subject of this instinctive trust returned to the table and sat down 
Mr. Wolfshiem drank his coffee with a jerk and got to his feet.
ÅgI have enjoyed my lunch,Åh he said, Ågand IÅfm going to run off from you two young 
men before I outstay my welcome.Åh
ÅgDonÅft hurry, Meyer,Åh said Gatsby, without enthusiasm. Mr. Wolfshiem raised his 
hand in a sort of benediction.
ÅgYouÅfre very polite, but I belong to another generation,Åh he announced solemnly. 
ÅgYou sit here and discuss your sports and your young ladies and your&#8212;&#8212;Åh He 
supplied an imaginary noun with another wave of his hand. ÅgAs for me, I am fifty 
years old, and I wonÅft impose myself on you any longer.Åh
As he shook hands and turned away his tragic nose was trembling. I wondered if I 
had said anything to offend him.
ÅgHe becomes very sentimental sometimes,Åh explained Gatsby. ÅgThis is one of his 
sentimental days. HeÅfs quite a character around New York&#8212;a denizen of Broadway.Åh
ÅgWho is he, anyhow, an actor?Åh
ÅgNo.Åh
ÅgA dentist?Åh
ÅgMeyer Wolfshiem? No, heÅfs a gambler.Åh Gatsby hesitated, then added coolly: 
ÅgHeÅfs the man who fixed the WorldÅfs Series back in 1919.Åh
ÅgFixed the WorldÅfs Series?Åh I repeated.
The idea staggered me. I remembered, of course, that the WorldÅfs Series had been 
fixed in 1919, but if I had thought of it at all I would have thought of it as a 
thing that merely HAPPENED, the end of some inevitable chain. It never occurred 
to me that one man could start to play with the faith of fifty million 
people&#8212;with the single-mindedness of a burglar blowing a safe.
ÅgHow did he happen to do that?Åh I asked after a minute.
ÅgHe just saw the opportunity.Åh
ÅgWhy isnÅft he in jail?Åh
ÅgThey canÅft get him, old sport. HeÅfs a smart man.Åh
I insisted on paying the check. As the waiter brought my change I caught sight 
of Tom Buchanan across the crowded room.
ÅgCome along with me for a minute,Åh I said; ÅgIÅfve got to say hello to some one.Åh 
When he saw us Tom jumped up and took half a dozen steps in our direction.
ÅgWhereÅfve you been?Åh he demamded eagerly. ÅgDaisyÅfs furious because you havenÅft 
called up.Åh
ÅgThis is Mr. Gatsby, Mr. Buchanan.Åh
They shook hands briefly, and a strained, unfamiliar look of embarrassment came 
over GatsbyÅfs face.
ÅgHowÅfve you been, anyhow?Åh demanded Tom of me. ÅgHowÅfd you happen to come up this 
far to eat?Åh
ÅgIÅfve been having lunch with Mr. Gatsby.Åh
I turned toward Mr. Gatsby, but he was no longer there.
One October day in nineteen-seventeen&#8212;&#8212;
(said Jordan Baker that afternoon, sitting up very straight on a straight chair 
in the tea-garden at the Plaza Hotel)
&#8212;I was walking along from one place to another, half on the sidewalks and half 
on the lawns. I was happier on the lawns because I had on shoes from England 
with rubber nobs on the soles that bit into the soft ground. I had on a new 
plaid skirt also that blew a little in the wind, and whenever this happened the 
red, white, and blue banners in front of all the houses stretched out stiff and 
said TUT-TUT-TUT-TUT, in a disapproving way.
The largest of the banners and the largest of the lawns belonged to Daisy FayÅfs 
house. She was just eighteen, two years older than me, and by far the most 
popular of all the young girls in Louisville. She dressed in white, and had a 
little white roadster, and all day long the telephone rang in her house and 
excited young officers from Camp Taylor demanded the privilege of monopolizing 
her that night. ÅgAnyways, for an hour!Åh
When I came opposite her house that morning her white roadster was beside the 
curb, and she was sitting in it with a lieutenant I had never seen before. They 
were so engrossed in each other that she didnÅft see me until I was five feet 
away.
ÅgHello, Jordan,Åh she called unexpectedly. ÅgPlease come here.Åh
I was flattered that she wanted to speak to me, because of all the older girls I 
admired her most. She asked me if I was going to the Red Cross and make 
bandages. I was. Well, then, would I tell them that she couldnÅft come that day? 
The officer looked at Daisy while she was speaking, in a way that every young 
girl wants to be looked at sometime, and because it seemed romantic to me I have 
remembered the incident ever since. His name was Jay Gatsby, and I didnÅft lay 
eyes on him again for over four years&#8212;even after IÅfd met him on Long Island I 
didnÅft realize it was the same man.
That was nineteen-seventeen. By the next year I had a few beaux myself, and I 
began to play in tournaments, so I didnÅft see Daisy very often. She went with a 
slightly older crowd&#8212;when she went with anyone at all. Wild rumors were 
circulating about her&#8212;how her mother had found her packing her bag one winter 
night to go to New York and say good-by to a soldier who was going overseas. She 
was effectually prevented, but she wasnÅft on speaking terms with her family for 
several weeks. After that she didnÅft play around with the soldiers any more, but 
only with a few flat-footed, short-sighted young men in town, who couldnÅft get 
into the army at all.
By the next autumn she was gay again, gay as ever. She had a debut after the 
Armistice, and in February she was presumably engaged to a man from New Orleans. 
In June she married Tom Buchanan of Chicago, with more pomp and circumstance 
than Louisville ever knew before. He came down with a hundred people in four 
private cars, and hired a whole floor of the Seelbach Hotel, and the day before 
the wedding he gave her a string of pearls valued at three hundred and fifty 
thousand dollars.
I was bridesmaid. I came into her room half an hour before the bridal dinner, 
and found her lying on her bed as lovely as the June night in her flowered 
dress&#8212;and as drunk as a monkey. she had a bottle of Sauterne in one hand and a 
letter in the other.
ÅgÅeGratulate me,Åh she muttered. ÅgNever had a drink before, but oh how I do enjoy 
it.Åh
ÅgWhatÅfs the matter, Daisy?Åh
I was scared, I can tell you; IÅfd never seen a girl like that before.
ÅgHere, dearesÅf.Åh She groped around in a waste-basket she had with her on the bed 
and pulled out the string of pearls. ÅgTake Åfem down-stairs and give Åfem back to 
whoever they belong to. Tell Åfem all DaisyÅfs changeÅf her mine. Say: ÅeDaisyÅfs 
changeÅf her mine!Åf.Åh
She began to cry&#8212;she cried and cried. I rushed out and found her motherÅfs maid, 
and we locked the door and got her into a cold bath. She wouldnÅft let go of the 
letter. She took it into the tub with her and squeezed it up into a wet ball, 
and only let me leave it in the soap-dish when she saw that it was coming to 
pieces like snow.
But she didnÅft say another word. We gave her spirits of ammonia and put ice on 
her forehead and hooked her back into her dress, and half an hour later, when we 
walked out of the room, the pearls were around her neck and the incident was 
over. Next day at five oÅfclock she married Tom Buchanan without so much as a 
shiver, and started off on a three monthsÅf trip to the South Seas.
I saw them in Santa Barbara when they came back, and I thought IÅfd never seen a 
girl so mad about her husband. If he left the room for a minute sheÅfd look 
around uneasily, and say: ÅgWhereÅfs Tom gone?Åh and wear the most abstracted 
expression until she saw him coming in the door. She used to sit on the sand 
with his head in her lap by the hour, rubbing her fingers over his eyes and 
looking at him with unfathomable delight. It was touching to see them 
together&#8212;it made you laugh in a hushed, fascinated way. That was in August. A 
week after I left Santa Barbara Tom ran into a wagon on the Ventura road one 
night, and ripped a front wheel off his car. The girl who was with him got into 
the papers, too, because her arm was broken&#8212;she was one of the chambermaids in 
the Santa Barbara Hotel.
The next April Daisy had her little girl, and they went to France for a year. I 
saw them one spring in Cannes, and later in Deauville, and then they came back 
to Chicago to settle down. Daisy was popular in Chicago, as you know. They moved 
with a fast crowd, all of them young and rich and wild, but she came out with an 
absolutely perfect reputation. Perhaps because she doesnÅft drink. ItÅfs a great 
advantage not to drink among hard-drinking people. You can hold your tongue, 
and, moreover, you can time any little irregularity of your own so that 
everybody else is so blind that they donÅft see or care. Perhaps Daisy never went 
in for amour at all&#8212;and yet thereÅfs something in that voice of hers. . . .
Well, about six weeks ago, she heard the name Gatsby for the first time in 
years. It was when I asked you&#8212;do you remember?&#8212;if you knew Gatsby in West Egg. 
After you had gone home she came into my room and woke me up, and said: ÅgWhat 
Gatsby?Åh and when I described him&#8212;I was half asleep&#8212;she said in the strangest 
voice that it must be the man she used to know. It wasnÅft until then that I 
connected this Gatsby with the officer in her white car.
When Jordan Baker had finished telling all this we had left the Plaza for half 
an hour and were driving in a victoria through Central Park. The sun had gone 
down behind the tall apartments of the movie stars in the West Fifties, and the 
clear voices of girls, already gathered like crickets on the grass, rose through 
the hot twilight:
  ÅgIÅfm the Sheik of Araby.
  Your love belongs to me.
  At night when youÅfre are asleep
  Into your tent IÅfll creep&#8212;&#8212;Åh
ÅgIt was a strange coincidence,Åh I said.
ÅgBut it wasnÅft a coincidence at all.Åh
ÅgWhy not?Åh
ÅgGatsby bought that house so that Daisy would be just across the bay.Åh
Then it had not been merely the stars to which he had aspired on that June 
night. He came alive to me, delivered suddenly from the womb of his purposeless 
splendor.
ÅgHe wants to know,Åh continued Jordan, Ågif youÅfll invite Daisy to your house some 
afternoon and then let him come over.Åh
The modesty of the demand shook me. He had waited five years and bought a 
mansion where he dispensed starlight to casual moths&#8212;so that he could Ågcome 
over.Åh some afternoon to a strangerÅfs garden.
ÅgDid I have to know all this before he could ask such a little thing?Åh
ÅgHeÅfs afraid, heÅfs waited so long. He thought you might be offended. You see, 
heÅfs a regular tough underneath it all.Åh
Something worried me.
ÅgWhy didnÅft he ask you to arrange a meeting?Åh
ÅgHe wants her to see his house,Åh she explained. ÅgAnd your house is right next 
door.Åh
ÅgOh!Åh
ÅgI think he half expected her to wander into one of his parties, some night,Åh 
went on Jordan, Ågbut she never did. Then he began asking people casually if they 
knew her, and I was the first one he found. It was that night he sent for me at 
his dance, and you should have heard the elaborate way he worked up to it. Of 
course, I immediately suggested a luncheon in New York&#8212;and I thought heÅfd go 
mad:
ÅgÅeI donÅft want to do anything out of the way!Åf he kept saying. ÅeI want to see 
her right next door.Åf
ÅgWhen I said you were a particular friend of TomÅfs, he started to abandon the 
whole idea. He doesnÅft know very much about Tom, though he says heÅfs read a 
Chicago paper for years just on the chance of catching a glimpse of DaisyÅfs 
name.Åh
It was dark now, and as we dipped under a little bridge I put my arm around 
JordanÅfs golden shoulder and drew her toward me and asked her to dinner. 
Suddenly I wasnÅft thinking of Daisy and Gatsby any more, but of this clean, 
hard, limited person, who dealt in universal scepticism, and who leaned back 
jauntily just within the circle of my arm. A phrase began to beat in my ears 
with a sort of heady excitement: ÅgThere are only the pursued, the pursuing, the 
busy and the tired.Åh
ÅgAnd Daisy ought to have something in her life,Åh murmured Jordan to me.
ÅgDoes she want to see Gatsby?Åh
ÅgSheÅfs not to know about it. Gatsby doesnÅft want her to know. YouÅfre just 
supposed to invite her to tea.Åh
We passed a barrier of dark trees, and then the facade of Fifty-ninth Street, a 
block of delicate pale light, beamed down into the park. Unlike Gatsby and Tom 
Buchanan, I had no girl whose disembodied face floated along the dark cornices 
and blinding signs, and so I drew up the girl beside me, tightening my arms. Her 
wan, scornful mouth smiled, and so I drew her up again closer, this time to my 
face.
Chapter 5
When I came home to West Egg that night I was afraid for a moment that my house 
was on fire. Two oÅfclock and the whole corner of the peninsula was blazing with 
light, which fell unreal on the shrubbery and made thin elongating glints upon 
the roadside wires. Turning a corner, I saw that it was GatsbyÅfs house, lit from 
tower to cellar.
At first I thought it was another party, a wild rout that had resolved itself 
into Åghide-and-go-seek.Åh or Ågsardines-in-the-box.Åh with all the house thrown 
open to the game. But there wasnÅft a sound. Only wind in the trees, which blew 
the wires and made the lights go off and on again as if the house had winked 
into the darkness. As my taxi groaned away I saw Gatsby walking toward me across 
his lawn.
ÅgYour place looks like the WorldÅfs Fair,Åh I said.
ÅgDoes it?Åh He turned his eyes toward it absently. ÅgI have been glancing into 
some of the rooms. LetÅfs go to Coney Island, old sport. In my car.Åh
ÅgItÅfs too late.Åh
ÅgWell, suppose we take a plunge in the swimming-pool? I havenÅft made use of it 
all summer.Åh
ÅgIÅfve got to go to bed.Åh
ÅgAll right.Åh
He waited, looking at me with suppressed eagerness.
ÅgI talked with Miss Baker,Åh I said after a moment. ÅgIÅfm going to call up Daisy 
to-morrow and invite her over here to tea.Åh
ÅgOh, thatÅfs all right,Åh he said carelessly. ÅgI donÅft want to put you to any 
trouble.Åh
ÅgWhat day would suit you?Åh
ÅgWhat day would suit YOU?Åh he corrected me quickly. ÅgI donÅft want to put you to 
any trouble, you see.Åh
ÅgHow about the day after to-morrow?Åh He considered for a moment. Then, with 
reluctance:
ÅgI want to get the grass cut,Åh he said.
We both looked at the grass&#8212;there was a sharp line where my ragged lawn ended 
and the darker, well-kept expanse of his began. I suspected that he meant my 
grass.
ÅgThereÅfs another little thing,Åh he said uncertainly, and hesitated.
ÅgWould you rather put it off for a few days?Åh I asked.
ÅgOh, it isnÅft about that. At least&#8212;&#8212;Åh He fumbled with a series of beginnings. 
ÅgWhy, I thought&#8212;why, look here, old sport, you donÅft make much money, do you?Åh
ÅgNot very much.Åh
This seemed to reassure him and he continued more confidently.
ÅgI thought you didnÅft, if youÅfll pardon my&#8212;You see, I carry on a little business 
on the side, a sort of side line, you understand. And I thought that if you 
donÅft make very much&#8212;YouÅfre selling bonds, arenÅft you, old sport?Åh
ÅgTrying to.Åh
ÅgWell, this would interest you. It wouldnÅft take up much of your time and you 
might pick up a nice bit of money. It happens to be a rather confidential sort 
of thing.Åh
I realize now that under different circumstances that conversation might have 
been one of the crises of my life. But, because the offer was obviously and 
tactlessly for a service to be rendered, I had no choice except to cut him off 
there.
ÅgIÅfve got my hands full,Åh I said. ÅgIÅfm much obliged but I couldnÅft take on any 
more work.Åh
ÅgYou wouldnÅft have to do any business with Wolfshiem.Åh Evidently he thought that 
I was shying away from the Åggonnegtion.Åh mentioned at lunch, but I assured him 
he was wrong. He waited a moment longer, hoping IÅfd begin a conversation, but I 
was too absorbed to be responsive, so he went unwillingly home.
The evening had made me light-headed and happy; I think I walked into a deep 
sleep as I entered my front door. So I didnÅft know whether or not Gatsby went to 
Coney Island, or for how many hours he Ågglanced into rooms.Åh while his house 
blazed gaudily on. I called up Daisy from the office next morning, and invited 
her to come to tea.
ÅgDonÅft bring Tom,Åh I warned her.
ÅgWhat?Åh
ÅgDonÅft bring Tom.Åh
ÅgWho is ÅeTomÅf?Åh she asked innocently.
The day agreed upon was pouring rain. At eleven oÅfclock a man in a raincoat, 
dragging a lawn-mower, tapped at my front door and said that Mr. Gatsby had sent 
him over to cut my grass. This reminded me that I had forgotten to tell my Finn 
to come back, so I drove into West Egg Village to search for her among soggy, 
whitewashed alleys and to buy some cups and lemons and flowers.
The flowers were unnecessary, for at two oÅfclock a greenhouse arrived from 
GatsbyÅfs, with innumerable receptacles to contain it. An hour later the front 
door opened nervously, and Gatsby, in a white flannel suit, silver shirt, and 
gold-colored tie, hurried in. He was pale, and there were dark signs of 
sleeplessness beneath his eyes.
ÅgIs everything all right?Åh he asked immediately.
ÅgThe grass looks fine, if thatÅfs what you mean.Åh
ÅgWhat grass?Åh he inquired blankly. ÅgOh, the grass in the yard.Åh He looked out 
the window at it, but, judging from his expression, I donÅft believe he saw a 
thing.
ÅgLooks very good,Åh he remarked vaguely. ÅgOne of the papers said they thought the 
rain would stop about four. I think it was the JOURNAL. Have you got everything 
you need in the shape of&#8212;of tea?Åh
I took him into the pantry, where he looked a little reproachfully at the Finn. 
Together we scrutinized the twelve lemon cakes from the delicatessen shop.
ÅgWill they do?Åh I asked.
ÅgOf course, of course! TheyÅfre fine!Åh and he added hollowly, Åg. . .old sport.Åh
The rain cooled about half-past three to a damp mist, through which occasional 
thin drops swam like dew. Gatsby looked with vacant eyes through a copy of 
ClayÅfs ECONOMICS, starting at the Finnish tread that shook the kitchen floor, 
and peering toward the bleared windows from time to time as if a series of 
invisible but alarming happenings were taking place outside. Finally he got up 
and informed me, in an uncertain voice, that he was going home.
ÅgWhyÅfs that?Åh
ÅgNobodyÅfs coming to tea. ItÅfs too late!Åh He looked at his watch as if there was 
some pressing demand on his time elsewhere. ÅgI canÅft wait all day.Åh
ÅgDonÅft be silly; itÅfs just two minutes to four.Åh
He sat down miserably, as if I had pushed him, and simultaneously there was the 
sound of a motor turning into my lane. We both jumped up, and, a little harrowed 
myself, I went out into the yard.
Under the dripping bare lilac-trees a large open car was coming up the drive. It 
stopped. DaisyÅfs face, tipped sideways beneath a three-cornered lavender hat, 
looked out at me with a bright ecstatic smile.
ÅgIs this absolutely where you live, my dearest one?Åh
The exhilarating ripple of her voice was a wild tonic in the rain. I had to 
follow the sound of it for a moment, up and down, with my ear alone, before any 
words came through. A damp streak of hair lay like a dash of blue paint across 
her cheek, and her hand was wet with glistening drops as I took it to help her 
from the car.
ÅgAre you in love with me,Åh she said low in my ear, Ågor why did I have to come 
alone?Åh
ÅgThatÅfs the secret of Castle Rackrent. Tell your chauffeur to go far away and 
spend an hour.Åh
ÅgCome back in an hour, Ferdie.Åh Then in a grave murmur: ÅgHis name is Ferdie.Åh
ÅgDoes the gasoline affect his nose?Åh
ÅgI donÅft think so,Åh she said innocently. ÅgWhy?Åh
We went in. To my overwhelming surprise the living-room was deserted.
ÅgWell, thatÅfs funny,Åh I exclaimed.
ÅgWhatÅfs funny?Åh
She turned her head as there was a light dignified knocking at the front door. I 
went out and opened it. Gatsby, pale as death, with his hands plunged like 
weights in his coat pockets, was standing in a puddle of water glaring 
tragically into my eyes.
With his hands still in his coat pockets he stalked by me into the hall, turned 
sharply as if he were on a wire, and disappeared into the living-room. It wasnÅft 
a bit funny. Aware of the loud beating of my own heart I pulled the door to 
against the increasing rain.
For half a minute there wasnÅft a sound. Then from the living-room I heard a sort 
of choking murmur and part of a laugh, followed by DaisyÅfs voice on a clear 
artificial note: ÅgI certainly am awfully glad to see you again.Åh
A pause; it endured horribly. I had nothing to do in the hall, so I went into 
the room.
Gatsby, his hands still in his pockets, was reclining against the mantelpiece in 
a strained counterfeit of perfect ease, even of boredom. His head leaned back so 
far that it rested against the face of a defunct mantelpiece clock, and from 
this position his distraught eyes stared down at Daisy, who was sitting, 
frightened but graceful, on the edge of a stiff chair.
ÅgWeÅfve met before,Åh muttered Gatsby. His eyes glanced momentarily at me, and his 
lips parted with an abortive attempt at a laugh. Luckily the clock took this 
moment to tilt dangerously at the pressure of his head, whereupon he turned and 
caught it with trembling fingers, and set it back in place. Then he sat down, 
rigidly, his elbow on the arm of the sofa and his chin in his hand.
ÅgIÅfm sorry about the clock,Åh he said.
My own face had now assumed a deep tropical burn. I couldnÅft muster up a single 
commonplace out of the thousand in my head.
ÅgItÅfs an old clock,Åh I told them idiotically.
I think we all believed for a moment that it had smashed in pieces on the floor.
ÅgWe havenÅft met for many years,Åh said Daisy, her voice as matter-of-fact as it 
could ever be.
ÅgFive years next November.Åh
The automatic quality of GatsbyÅfs answer set us all back at least another 
minute. I had them both on their feet with the desperate suggestion that they 
help me make tea in the kitchen when the demoniac Finn brought it in on a tray.
Amid the welcome confusion of cups and cakes a certain physical decency 
established itself. Gatsby got himself into a shadow and, while Daisy and I 
talked, looked conscientiously from one to the other of us with tense, unhappy 
eyes. However, as calmness wasnÅft an end in itself, I made an excuse at the 
first possible moment, and got to my feet.
ÅgWhere are you going?Åh demanded Gatsby in immediate alarm.
ÅgIÅfll be back.Åh
ÅgIÅfve got to speak to you about something before you go.Åh
He followed me wildly into the kitchen, closed the door, and whispered:
ÅgOh, God!Åh in a miserable way.
ÅgWhatÅfs the matter?Åh
ÅgThis is a terrible mistake,Åh he said, shaking his head from side to side, Åga 
terrible, terrible mistake.Åh
ÅgYouÅfre just embarrassed, thatÅfs all,Åh and luckily I added: ÅgDaisyÅfs embarrassed 
too.Åh
ÅgSheÅfs embarrassed?Åh he repeated incredulously.
ÅgJust as much as you are.Åh
ÅgDonÅft talk so loud.Åh
ÅgYouÅfre acting like a little boy,Åh I broke out impatiently. ÅgNot only that, but 
youÅfre rude. DaisyÅfs sitting in there all alone.Åh
He raised his hand to stop my words, looked at me with unforgettable reproach, 
and, opening the door cautiously, went back into the other room.
I walked out the back way&#8212;just as Gatsby had when he had made his nervous 
circuit of the house half an hour before&#8212;and ran for a huge black knotted tree, 
whose massed leaves made a fabric against the rain. Once more it was pouring, 
and my irregular lawn, well-shaved by GatsbyÅfs gardener, abounded in small, 
muddy swamps and prehistoric marshes. There was nothing to look at from under 
the tree except GatsbyÅfs enormous house, so I stared at it, like Kant at his 
church steeple, for half an hour. A brewer had built it early in the Ågperiod.Åh 
craze, a decade before, and there was a story that heÅfd agreed to pay five 
yearsÅf taxes on all the neighboring cottages if the owners would have their 
roofs thatched with straw. Perhaps their refusal took the heart out of his plan 
to Found a Family&#8212;he went into an immediate decline. His children sold his house 
with the black wreath still on the door. Americans, while occasionally willing 
to be serfs, have always been obstinate about being peasantry.
After half an hour, the sun shone again, and the grocerÅfs automobile rounded 
GatsbyÅfs drive with the raw material for his servantsÅf dinner&#8212;I felt sure he 
wouldnÅft eat a spoonful. A maid began opening the upper windows of his house, 
appeared momentarily in each, and, leaning from a large central bay, spat 
meditatively into the garden. It was time I went back. While the rain continued 
it had seemed like the murmur of their voices, rising and swelling a little now 
and then with gusts of emotion. But in the new silence I felt that silence had 
fallen within the house too.
I went in&#8212;after making every possible noise in the kitchen, short of pushing 
over the stove&#8212;but I donÅft believe they heard a sound. They were sitting at 
either end of the couch, looking at each other as if some question had been 
asked, or was in the air, and every vestige of embarrassment was gone. DaisyÅfs 
face was smeared with tears, and when I came in she jumped up and began wiping 
at it with her handkerchief before a mirror. But there was a change in Gatsby 
that was simply confounding. He literally glowed; without a word or a gesture of 
exultation a new well-being radiated from him and filled the little room.
ÅgOh, hello, old sport,Åh he said, as if he hadnÅft seen me for years. I thought 
for a moment he was going to shake hands.
ÅgItÅfs stopped raining.Åh
ÅgHas it?Åh When he realized what I was talking about, that there were 
twinkle-bells of sunshine in the room, he smiled like a weather man, like an 
ecstatic patron of recurrent light, and repeated the news to Daisy. ÅgWhat do you 
think of that? ItÅfs stopped raining.Åh
ÅgIÅfm glad, Jay.Åh Her throat, full of aching, grieving beauty, told only of her 
unexpected joy.
ÅgI want you and Daisy to come over to my house,Åh he said, ÅgIÅfd like to show her 
around.Åh
ÅgYouÅfre sure you want me to come?Åh
ÅgAbsolutely, old sport.Åh
Daisy went up-stairs to wash her face&#8212;too late I thought with humiliation of my 
towels&#8212;while Gatsby and I waited on the lawn.
ÅgMy house looks well, doesnÅft it?Åh he demanded. ÅgSee how the whole front of it 
catches the light.Åh
I agreed that it was splendid.
ÅgYes.Åh His eyes went over it, every arched door and square tower. ÅgIt took me 
just three years to earn the money that bought it.Åh
ÅgI thought you inherited your money.Åh
ÅgI did, old sport,Åh he said automatically, Ågbut I lost most of it in the big 
panic&#8212;the panic of the war.Åh
I think he hardly knew what he was saying, for when I asked him what business he 
was in he answered, ÅgThatÅfs my affair,Åh before he realized that it wasnÅft the 
appropriate reply.
ÅgOh, IÅfve been in several things,Åh he corrected himself. ÅgI was in the drug 
business and then I was in the oil business. But IÅfm not in either one now.Åh He 
looked at me with more attention. ÅgDo you mean youÅfve been thinking over what I 
proposed the other night?Åh
Before I could answer, Daisy came out of the house and two rows of brass buttons 
on her dress gleamed in the sunlight.
ÅgThat huge place THERE?Åh she cried pointing.
ÅgDo you like it?Åh
ÅgI love it, but I donÅft see how you live there all alone.Åh
ÅgI keep it always full of interesting people, night and day. People who do 
interesting things. Celebrated people.Åh
Instead of taking the short cut along the Sound we went down the road and 
entered by the big postern. With enchanting murmurs Daisy admired this aspect or 
that of the feudal silhouette against the sky, admired the gardens, the 
sparkling odor of jonquils and the frothy odor of hawthorn and plum blossoms and 
the pale gold odor of kiss-me-at-the-gate. It was strange to reach the marble 
steps and find no stir of bright dresses in and out the door, and hear no sound 
but bird voices in the trees.
And inside, as we wandered through Marie Antoinette music-rooms and Restoration 
salons, I felt that there were guests concealed behind every couch and table, 
under orders to be breathlessly silent until we had passed through. As Gatsby 
closed the door of Ågthe Merton College Library.Åh I could have sworn I heard the 
owl-eyed man break into ghostly laughter.
We went up-stairs, through period bedrooms swathed in rose and lavender silk and 
vivid with new flowers, through dressing-rooms and poolrooms, and bathrooms with 
sunken baths&#8212;intruding into one chamber where a dishevelled man in pajamas was 
doing liver exercises on the floor. It was Mr. Klipspringer, the Ågboarder.Åh I 
had seen him wandering hungrily about the beach that morning. Finally we came to 
GatsbyÅfs own apartment, a bedroom and a bath, and an Adam study, where we sat 
down and drank a glass of some Chartreuse he took from a cupboard in the wall.
He hadnÅft once ceased looking at Daisy, and I think he revalued everything in 
his house according to the measure of response it drew from her well-loved eyes. 
Sometimes, too, he stared around at his possessions in a dazed way, as though in 
her actual and astounding presence none of it was any longer real. Once he 
nearly toppled down a flight of stairs.
His bedroom was the simplest room of all&#8212;except where the dresser was garnished 
with a toilet set of pure dull gold. Daisy took the brush with delight, and 
smoothed her hair, whereupon Gatsby sat down and shaded his eyes and began to 
laugh.
ÅgItÅfs the funniest thing, old sport,Åh he said hilariously. ÅgI canÅft&#8212;When I try 
to&#8212;&#8212;Åh
He had passed visibly through two states and was entering upon a third. After 
his embarrassment and his unreasoning joy he was consumed with wonder at her 
presence. He had been full of the idea so long, dreamed it right through to the 
end, waited with his teeth set, so to speak, at an inconceivable pitch of 
intensity. Now, in the reaction, he was running down like an overwound clock.
Recovering himself in a minute he opened for us two hulking patent cabinets 
which held his massed suits and dressing-gowns and ties, and his shirts, piled 
like bricks in stacks a dozen high.
ÅgIÅfve got a man in England who buys me clothes. He sends over a selection of 
things at the beginning of each season, spring and fall.Åh
He took out a pile of shirts and began throwing them, one by one, before us, 
shirts of sheer linen and thick silk and fine flannel, which lost their folds as 
they fell and covered the table in many-colored disarray. While we admired he 
brought more and the soft rich heap mounted higher&#8212;shirts with stripes and 
scrolls and plaids in coral and apple-green and lavender and faint orange, and 
monograms of Indian blue. Suddenly, with a strained sound, Daisy bent her head 
into the shirts and began to cry stormily.
ÅgTheyÅfre such beautiful shirts,Åh she sobbed, her voice muffled in the thick 
folds. ÅgIt makes me sad because IÅfve never seen such&#8212;such beautiful shirts 
before.Åh
After the house, we were to see the grounds and the swimming-pool, and the 
hydroplane and the mid-summer flowers&#8212;but outside GatsbyÅfs window it began to 
rain again, so we stood in a row looking at the corrugated surface of the Sound.
ÅgIf it wasnÅft for the mist we could see your home across the bay,Åh said Gatsby. 
ÅgYou always have a green light that burns all night at the end of your dock.Åh
Daisy put her arm through his abruptly, but he seemed absorbed in what he had 
just said. Possibly it had occurred to him that the colossal significance of 
that light had now vanished forever. Compared to the great distance that had 
separated him from Daisy it had seemed very near to her, almost touching her. It 
had seemed as close as a star to the moon. Now it was again a green light on a 
dock. His count of enchanted objects had diminished by one.
I began to walk about the room, examining various indefinite objects in the half 
darkness. A large photograph of an elderly man in yachting costume attracted me, 
hung on the wall over his desk.
ÅgWhoÅfs this?Åh
ÅgThat? ThatÅfs Mr. Dan Cody, old sport.Åh
The name sounded faintly familiar.
ÅgHeÅfs dead now. He used to be my best friend years ago.Åh
There was a small picture of Gatsby, also in yachting costume, on the 
bureau&#8212;Gatsby with his head thrown back defiantly&#8212;taken apparently when he was 
about eighteen.
ÅgI adore it,Åh exclaimed Daisy. ÅgThe pompadour! You never told me you had a 
pompadour&#8212;or a yacht.Åh
ÅgLook at this,Åh said Gatsby quickly. ÅgHereÅfs a lot of clippings&#8212;about you.Åh
They stood side by side examining it. I was going to ask to see the rubies when 
the phone rang, and Gatsby took up the receiver.
ÅgYes. . . . well, I canÅft talk now. . . . I canÅft talk now, old sport. . . . I 
said a SMALL town. . . . he must know what a small town is. . . . well, heÅfs no 
use to us if Detroit is his idea of a small town. . . .Åh
He rang off.
ÅgCome here QUICK!Åh cried Daisy at the window.
The rain was still falling, but the darkness had parted in the west, and there 
was a pink and golden billow of foamy clouds above the sea.
ÅgLook at that,Åh she whispered, and then after a moment: ÅgIÅfd like to just get 
one of those pink clouds and put you in it and push you around.Åh
I tried to go then, but they wouldnÅft hear of it; perhaps my presence made them 
feel more satisfactorily alone.
ÅgI know what weÅfll do,Åh said Gatsby, ÅgweÅfll have Klipspringer play the piano.Åh
He went out of the room calling ÅgEwing!Åh and returned in a few minutes 
accompanied by an embarrassed, slightly worn young man, with shell-rimmed 
glasses and scanty blond hair. He was now decently clothed in a Ågsport shirt,Åh 
open at the neck, sneakers, and duck trousers of a nebulous hue.
ÅgDid we interrupt your exercises?Åh inquired Daisy politely.
ÅgI was asleep,Åh cried Mr. Klipspringer, in a spasm of embarrassment. ÅgThat is, 
IÅfd BEEN asleep. Then I got up. . . .Åh
ÅgKlipspringer plays the piano,Åh said Gatsby, cutting him off. ÅgDonÅft you, Ewing, 
old sport?Åh
ÅgI donÅft play well. I donÅft&#8212;I hardly play at all. IÅfm all out of prac&#8212;&#8212;Åh
ÅgWeÅfll go down-stairs,Åh interrupted Gatsby. He flipped a switch. The gray 
windows disappeared as the house glowed full of light.
In the music-room Gatsby turned on a solitary lamp beside the piano. He lit 
DaisyÅfs cigarette from a trembling match, and sat down with her on a couch far 
across the room, where there was no light save what the gleaming floor bounced 
in from the hall.
When Klipspringer had played THE LOVE NEST. he turned around on the bench and 
searched unhappily for Gatsby in the gloom.
ÅgIÅfm all out of practice, you see. I told you I couldnÅft play. IÅfm all out of 
prac&#8212;&#8212;Åh
ÅgDonÅft talk so much, old sport,Åh commanded Gatsby. ÅgPlay!Åh
  ÅgIN THE MORNING,
  IN THE EVENING,
  AINÅfT WE GOT FUN&#8212;&#8212;Åh
Outside the wind was loud and there was a faint flow of thunder along the Sound. 
All the lights were going on in West Egg now; the electric trains, men-carrying, 
were plunging home through the rain from New York. It was the hour of a profound 
human change, and excitement was generating on the air.
  ÅgONE THINGÅfS SURE AND NOTHINGÅfS SURER
  THE RICH GET RICHER AND THE POOR GET&#8212;CHILDREN.
  IN THE MEANTIME,
  IN BETWEEN TIME&#8212;&#8212;Åh
As I went over to say good-by I saw that the expression of bewilderment had come 
back into GatsbyÅfs face, as though a faint doubt had occurred to him as to the 
quality of his present happiness. Almost five years! There must have been 
moments even that afternoon whe Daisy tumbled short of his dreams&#8212;not through 
her own fault, but because of the colossal vitality of his illusion. It had gone 
beyond her, beyond everything. He had thrown himself into it with a creative 
passion, adding to it all the time, decking it out with every bright feather 
that drifted his way. No amount of fire or freshness can challenge what a man 
will store up in his ghostly heart.
As I watched him he adjusted himself a little, visibly. His hand took hold of 
hers, and as she said something low in his ear he turned toward her with a rush 
of emotion. I think that voice held him most, with its fluctuating, feverish 
warmth, because it couldnÅft be over-dreamed&#8212;that voice was a deathless song.
They had forgotten me, but Daisy glanced up and held out her hand; Gatsby didnÅft 
know me now at all. I looked once more at them and they looked back at me, 
remotely, possessed by intense life. Then I went out of the room and down the 
marble steps into the rain, leaving them there together.
Chapter 6
About this time an ambitious young reporter from New York arrived one morning at 
GatsbyÅfs door and asked him if he had anything to say.
ÅgAnything to say about what?Åh inquired Gatsby politely.
ÅgWhy&#8212;any statement to give out.Åh
It transpired after a confused five minutes that the man had heard GatsbyÅfs name 
around his office in a connection which he either wouldnÅft reveal or didnÅft 
fully understand. This was his day off and with laudable initiative he had 
hurried out Ågto see.Åh
It was a random shot, and yet the reporterÅfs instinct was right. GatsbyÅfs 
notoriety, spread about by the hundreds who had accepted his hospitality and so 
become authorities on his past, had increased all summer until he fell just 
short of being news. Contemporary legends such as the Ågunderground pipe-line to 
Canada.Åh attached themselves to him, and there was one persistent story that he 
didnÅft live in a house at all, but in a boat that looked like a house and was 
moved secretly up and down the Long Island shore. Just why these inventions were 
a source of satisfaction to James Gatz of North Dakota, isnÅft easy to say.
James Gatz&#8212;that was really, or at least legally, his name. He had changed it at 
the age of seventeen and at the specific moment that witnessed the beginning of 
his career&#8212;when he saw Dan CodyÅfs yacht drop anchor over the most insidious flat 
on Lake Superior. It was James Gatz who had been loafing along the beach that 
afternoon in a torn green jersey and a pair of canvas pants, but it was already 
Jay Gatsby who borrowed a rowboat, pulled out to the TUOLOMEE, and informed Cody 
that a wind might catch him and break him up in half an hour.
I suppose heÅfd had the name ready for a long time, even then. His parents were 
shiftless and unsuccessful farm people&#8212;his imagination had never really accepted 
them as his parents at all. The truth was that Jay Gatsby of West Egg, Long 
Island, sprang from his Platonic conception of himself. He was a son of God&#8212;a 
phrase which, if it means anything, means just that&#8212;and he must be about His 
FatherÅfs business, the service of a vast, vulgar, and meretricious beauty. So he 
invented just the sort of Jay Gatsby that a seventeen-year-old boy would be 
likely to invent, and to this conception he was faithful to the end.
For over a year he had been beating his way along the south shore of Lake 
Superior as a clam-digger and a salmon-fisher or in any other capacity that 
brought him food and bed. His brown, hardening body lived naturally through the 
half-fierce, half-lazy work of the bracing days. He knew women early, and since 
they spoiled him he became contemptuous of them, of young virgins because they 
were ignorant, of the others because they were hysterical about things which in 
his overwhelming self-absorbtion he took for granted.
But his heart was in a constant, turbulent riot. The most grotesque and 
fantastic conceits haunted him in his bed at night. A universe of ineffable 
gaudiness spun itself out in his brain while the clock ticked on the wash-stand 
and the moon soaked with wet light his tangled clothes upon the floor. Each 
night he added to the pattern of his fancies until drowsiness closed down upon 
some vivid scene with an oblivious embrace. For a while these reveries provided 
an outlet for his imagination; they were a satisfactory hint of the unreality of 
reality, a promise that the rock of the world was founded securely on a fairyÅfs 
wing.
An instinct toward his future glory had led him, some months before, to the 
small Lutheran college of St. Olaf in southern Minnesota. He stayed there two 
weeks, dismayed at its ferocious indifference to the drums of his destiny, to 
destiny itself, and despising the janitorÅfs work with which he was to pay his 
way through. Then he drifted back to Lake Superior, and he was still searching 
for something to do on the day that Dan CodyÅfs yacht dropped anchor in the 
shallows alongshore.
Cody was fifty years old then, a product of the Nevada silver fields, of the 
Yukon, of every rush for metal since seventy-five. The transactions in Montana 
copper that made him many times a millionaire found him physically robust but on 
the verge of soft-mindedness, and, suspecting this, an infinite number of women 
tried to separate him from his money. The none too savory ramifications by which 
Ella Kaye, the newspaper woman, played Madame de Maintenon to his weakness and 
sent him to sea in a yacht, were common knowledge to the turgid sub-journalism 
of 1902. He had been coasting along all too hospitable shores for five years 
when he turned up as James GatzÅfs destiny at Little Girls Point.
To the young Gatz, resting on his oars and looking up at the railed deck, the 
yacht represented all the beauty and glamour in the world. I suppose he smiled 
at Cody&#8212;he had probably discovered that people liked him when he smiled. At any 
rate Cody asked him a few questions (one of them elicited the brand new name) 
and found that he was quick and extravagantly ambitious. A few days later he 
took him to Duluth and bought him a blue coat, six pair of white duck trousers, 
and a yachting cap. And when the TUOLOMEE left for the West Indies and the 
Barbary Coast Gatsby left too.
He was employed in a vague personal capacity&#8212;while he remained with Cody he was 
in turn steward, mate, skipper, secretary, and even jailor, for Dan Cody sober 
knew what lavish doings Dan Cody drunk might soon be about, and he provided for 
such contingencies by reposing more and more trust in Gatsby. The arrangement 
lasted five years, during which the boat went three times around the Continent. 
It might have lasted indefinitely except for the fact that Ella Kaye came on 
board one night in Boston and a week later Dan Cody inhospitably died.
I remember the portrait of him up in GatsbyÅfs bedroom, a gray, florid man with a 
hard, empty face&#8212;the pioneer debauchee, who during one phase of American life 
brought back to the Eastern seaboard the savage violence of the frontier brothel 
and saloon. It was indirectly due to Cody that Gatsby drank so little. Sometimes 
in the course of gay parties women used to rub champagne into his hair; for 
himself he formed the habit of letting liquor alone.
And it was from Cody that he inherited money&#8212;a legacy of twenty-five thousand 
dollars. He didnÅft get it. He never understood the legal device that was used 
against him, but what remained of the millions went intact to Ella Kaye. He was 
left with his singularly appropriate education; the vague contour of Jay Gatsby 
had filled out to the substantiality of a man.
He told me all this very much later, but IÅfve put it down here with the idea of 
exploding those first wild rumors about his antecedents, which werenÅft even 
faintly true. Moreover he told it to me at a time of confusion, when I had 
reached the point of believing everything and nothing about him. So I take 
advantage of this short halt, while Gatsby, so to speak, caught his breath, to 
clear this set of misconceptions away.
It was a halt, too, in my association with his affairs. For several weeks I 
didnÅft see him or hear his voice on the phone&#8212;mostly I was in New York, trotting 
around with Jordan and trying to ingratiate myself with her senile aunt&#8212;but 
finally I went over to his house one Sunday afternoon. I hadnÅft been there two 
minutes when somebody brought Tom Buchanan in for a drink. I was startled, 
naturally, but the really surprising thing was that it hadnÅft happened before.
They were a party of three on horseback&#8212;Tom and a man named Sloane and a pretty 
woman in a brown riding-habit, who had been there previously.
ÅgIÅfm delighted to see you,Åh said Gatsby, standing on his porch. ÅgIÅfm delighted 
that you dropped in.Åh
As though they cared!
ÅgSit right down. Have a cigarette or a cigar.Åh He walked around the room 
quickly, ringing bells. ÅgIÅfll have something to drink for you in just a minute.Åh
He was profoundly affected by the fact that Tom was there. But he would be 
uneasy anyhow until he had given them something, realizing in a vague way that 
that was all they came for. Mr. Sloane wanted nothing. A lemonade? No, thanks. A 
little champagne? Nothing at all, thanks. . . . IÅfm sorry&#8212;&#8212;
ÅgDid you have a nice ride?Åh
ÅgVery good roads around here.Åh
ÅgI suppose the automobiles&#8212;&#8212;Åh
ÅgYeah.Åh
Moved by an irresistible impulse, Gatsby turned to Tom, who had accepted the 
introduction as a stranger.
ÅgI believe weÅfve met somewhere before, Mr. Buchanan.Åh
ÅgOh, yes,Åh said Tom, gruffly polite, but obviously not remembering. ÅgSo we did. 
I remember very well.Åh
ÅgAbout two weeks ago.Åh
ÅgThatÅfs right. You were with Nick here.Åh
ÅgI know your wife,Åh continued Gatsby, almost aggressively.
ÅgThat so?Åh
Tom turned to me.
ÅgYou live near here, Nick?Åh
ÅgNext door.Åh
ÅgThat so?Åh
Mr. Sloane didnÅft enter into the conversation, but lounged back haughtily in his 
chair; the woman said nothing either&#8212;until unexpectedly, after two highballs, 
she became cordial.
ÅgWeÅfll all come over to your next party, Mr. Gatsby,Åh she suggested. ÅgWhat do 
you say?Åh
ÅgCertainly; IÅfd be delighted to have you.Åh
ÅgBe verÅf nice,Åh said Mr. Sloane, without gratitude. ÅgWell&#8212;think ought to be 
starting home.Åh
ÅgPlease donÅft hurry,Åh Gatsby urged them. He had control of himself now, and he 
wanted to see more of Tom. ÅgWhy donÅft you&#8212;why donÅft you stay for supper? I 
wouldnÅft be surprised if some other people dropped in from New York.Åh
ÅgYou come to supper with ME,Åh said the lady enthusiastically. ÅgBoth of you.Åh
This included me. Mr. Sloane got to his feet.
ÅgCome along,Åh he said&#8212;but to her only.
ÅgI mean it,Åh she insisted. ÅgIÅfd love to have you. Lots of room.Åh
Gatsby looked at me questioningly. He wanted to go, and he didnÅft see that Mr. 
Sloane had determined he shouldnÅft.
ÅgIÅfm afraid I wonÅft be able to,Åh I said.
ÅgWell, you come,Åh she urged, concentrating on Gatsby.
Mr. Sloane murmured something close to her ear.
ÅgWe wonÅft be late if we start now,Åh she insisted aloud.
ÅgI havenÅft got a horse,Åh said Gatsby. ÅgI used to ride in the army, but IÅfve 
never bought a horse. IÅfll have to follow you in my car. Excuse me for just a 
minute.Åh
The rest of us walked out on the porch, where Sloane and the lady began an 
impassioned conversation aside.
ÅgMy God, I believe the manÅfs coming,Åh said Tom. ÅgDoesnÅft he know she doesnÅft 
want him?Åh
ÅgShe says she does want him.Åh
ÅgShe has a big dinner party and he wonÅft know a soul there.Åh He frowned. ÅgI 
wonder where in the devil he met Daisy. By God, I may be old-fashioned in my 
ideas, but women run around too much these days to suit me. They meet all kinds 
of crazy fish.Åh
Suddenly Mr. Sloane and the lady walked down the steps and mounted their horses.
ÅgCome on,Åh said Mr. Sloane to Tom, ÅgweÅfre late. WeÅfve got to go.Åh And then to 
me: ÅgTell him we couldnÅft wait, will you?Åh
Tom and I shook hands, the rest of us exchanged a cool nod, and they trotted 
quickly down the drive, disappearing under the August foliage just as Gatsby, 
with hat and light overcoat in hand, came out the front door.
Tom was evidently perturbed at DaisyÅfs running around alone, for on the 
following Saturday night he came with her to GatsbyÅfs party. Perhaps his 
presence gave the evening its peculiar quality of oppressiveness&#8212;it stands out 
in my memory from GatsbyÅfs other parties that summer. There were the same 
people, or at least the same sort of people, the same profusion of champagne, 
the same many-colored, many-keyed commotion, but I felt an unpleasantness in the 
air, a pervading harshness that hadnÅft been there before. Or perhaps I had 
merely grown used to it, grown to accept West Egg as a world complete in itself, 
with its own standards and its own great figures, second to nothing because it 
had no consciousness of being so, and now I was looking at it again, through 
DaisyÅfs eyes. It is invariably saddening to look through new eyes at things upon 
which you have expended your own powers of adjustment.
They arrived at twilight, and, as we strolled out among the sparkling hundreds, 
DaisyÅfs voice was playing murmurous tricks in her throat.
ÅgThese things excite me so,Åh she whispered.
ÅgIf you want to kiss me any time during the evening, Nick, just let me know and 
IÅfll be glad to arrange it for you. Just mention my name. Or present a green 
card. IÅfm giving out green&#8212;&#8212;Åh
ÅgLook around,Åh suggested Gatsby.
ÅgIÅfm looking around. IÅfm having a marvelous&#8212;&#8212;Åh
ÅgYou must see the faces of many people youÅfve heard about.Åh
TomÅfs arrogant eyes roamed the crowd.
ÅgWe donÅft go around very much,Åh he said. ÅgIn fact, I was just thinking I donÅft 
know a soul here.Åh
ÅgPerhaps you know that lady.Åh Gatsby indicated a gorgeous, scarcely human orchid 
of a woman who sat in state under a white plum tree. Tom and Daisy stared, with 
that peculiarly unreal feeling that accompanies the recognition of a hitherto 
ghostly celebrity of the movies.
ÅgSheÅfs lovely,Åh said Daisy.
ÅgThe man bending over her is her director.Åh
He took them ceremoniously from group to group:
ÅgMrs. Buchanan . . . and Mr. Buchanan&#8212;&#8212;Åh After an instantÅfs hesitation he added: 
Ågthe polo player.Åh
ÅgOh no,Åh objected Tom quickly, Ågnot me.Åh
But evidently the sound of it pleased Gatsby, for Tom remained Ågthe polo 
player.Åh for the rest of the evening.
ÅgIÅfve never met so many celebrities!Åh Daisy exclaimed. ÅgI liked that man&#8212;what 
was his name?&#8212;with the sort of blue nose.Åh
Gatsby identified him, adding that he was a small producer.
ÅgWell, I liked him anyhow.Åh
ÅgIÅfd a little rather not be the polo player,Åh said Tom pleasantly, ÅgIÅfd rather 
look at all these famous people in&#8212;in oblivion.Åh
Daisy and Gatsby danced. I remember being surprised by his graceful, 
conservative fox-trot&#8212;I had never seen him dance before. Then they sauntered 
over to my house and sat on the steps for half an hour, while at her request I 
remained watchfully in the garden. ÅgIn case thereÅfs a fire or a flood,Åh she 
explained, Ågor any act of God.Åh
Tom appeared from his oblivion as we were sitting down to supper together. ÅgDo 
you mind if I eat with some people over here?Åh he said. ÅgA fellowÅfs getting off 
some funny stuff.Åh
ÅgGo ahead,Åh answered Daisy genially, Ågand if you want to take down any addresses 
hereÅfs my little gold pencil.Åh . . . she looked around after a moment and told 
me the girl was Ågcommon but pretty,Åh and I knew that except for the half-hour 
sheÅfd been alone with Gatsby she wasnÅft having a good time.
We were at a particularly tipsy table. That was my fault&#8212;Gatsby had been called 
to the phone, and IÅfd enjoyed these same people only two weeks before. But what 
had amused me then turned septic on the air now.
ÅgHow do you feel, Miss Baedeker?Åh
The girl addressed was trying, unsuccessfully, to slump against my shoulder. At 
this inquiry she sat up and opened her eyes.
ÅgWhaÅf?Åh
A massive and lethargic woman, who had been urging Daisy to play golf with her 
at the local club to-morrow, spoke in Miss BaedekerÅfs defence:
ÅgOh, sheÅfs all right now. When sheÅfs had five or six cocktails she always starts 
screaming like that. I tell her she ought to leave it alone.Åh
ÅgI do leave it alone,Åh affirmed the accused hollowly.
ÅgWe heard you yelling, so I said to Doc Civet here: ÅeThereÅfs somebody that needs 
your help, Doc.ÅfÅh
ÅgSheÅfs much obliged, IÅfm sure,Åh said another friend, without gratitude. ÅgBut you 
got her dress all wet when you stuck her head in the pool.Åh
ÅgAnything I hate is to get my head stuck in a pool,Åh mumbled Miss Baedeker. 
ÅgThey almost drowned me once over in New Jersey.Åh
ÅgThen you ought to leave it alone,Åh countered Doctor Civet.
ÅgSpeak for yourself!Åh cried Miss Baedeker violently. ÅgYour hand shakes. I 
wouldnÅft let you operate on me!Åh
It was like that. Almost the last thing I remember was standing with Daisy and 
watching the moving-picture director and his Star. They were still under the 
white plum tree and their faces were touching except for a pale, thin ray of 
moonlight between. It occurred to me that he had been very slowly bending toward 
her all evening to attain this proximity, and even while I watched I saw him 
stoop one ultimate degree and kiss at her cheek.
ÅgI like her,Åh said Daisy, ÅgI think sheÅfs lovely.Åh
But the rest offended her&#8212;and inarguably, because it wasnÅft a gesture but an 
emotion. She was appalled by West Egg, this unprecedented Ågplace.Åh that Broadway 
had begotten upon a Long Island fishing village&#8212;appalled by its raw vigor that 
chafed under the old euphemisms and by the too obtrusive fate that herded its 
inhabitants along a short-cut from nothing to nothing. She saw something awful 
in the very simplicity she failed to understand.
I sat on the front steps with them while they waited for their car. It was dark 
here in front; only the bright door sent ten square feet of light volleying out 
into the soft black morning. Sometimes a shadow moved against a dressing-room 
blind above, gave way to another shadow, an indefinite procession of shadows, 
who rouged and powdered in an invisible glass.
ÅgWho is this Gatsby anyhow?Åh demanded Tom suddenly. ÅgSome big bootlegger?Åh
ÅgWhereÅfd you hear that?Åh I inquired.
ÅgI didnÅft hear it. I imagined it. A lot of these newly rich people are just big 
bootleggers, you know.Åh
ÅgNot Gatsby,Åh I said shortly.
He was silent for a moment. The pebbles of the drive crunched under his feet.
ÅgWell, he certainly must have strained himself to get this menagerie together.Åh
A breeze stirred the gray haze of DaisyÅfs fur collar.
ÅgAt least theyÅfre more interesting than the people we know,Åh she said with an 
effort.
ÅgYou didnÅft look so interested.Åh
ÅgWell, I was.Åh
Tom laughed and turned to me.
ÅgDid you notice DaisyÅfs face when that girl asked her to put her under a cold 
shower?Åh
Daisy began to sing with the music in a husky, rhythmic whisper, bringing out a 
meaning in each word that it had never had before and would never have again. 
When the melody rose, her voice broke up sweetly, following it, in a way 
contralto voices have, and each change tipped out a little of her warm human 
magic upon the air.
ÅgLots of people come who havenÅft been invited,Åh she said suddenly. ÅgThat girl 
hadnÅft been invited. They simply force their way in and heÅfs too polite to 
object.Åh
ÅgIÅfd like to know who he is and what he does,Åh insisted Tom. ÅgAnd I think IÅfll 
make a point of finding out.Åh
ÅgI can tell you right now,Åh she answered. ÅgHe owned some drug-stores, a lot of 
drug-stores. He built them up himself.Åh
The dilatory limousine came rolling up the drive.
ÅgGood night, Nick,Åh said Daisy.
Her glance left me and sought the lighted top of the steps, where THREE OÅfCLOCK 
IN THE MORNING, a neat, sad little waltz of that year, was drifting out the open 
door. After all, in the very casualness of GatsbyÅfs party there were romantic 
possibilities totally absent from her world. What was it up there in the song 
that seemed to be calling her back inside? What would happen now in the dim, 
incalculable hours? Perhaps some unbelievable guest would arrive, a person 
infinitely rare and to be marvelled at, some authentically radiant young girl 
who with one fresh glance at Gatsby, one moment of magical encounter, would blot 
out those five years of unwavering devotion.
I stayed late that night, Gatsby asked me to wait until he was free, and I 
lingered in the garden until the inevitable swimming party had run up, chilled 
and exalted, from the black beach, until the lights were extinguished in the 
guest-rooms overhead. When he came down the steps at last the tanned skin was 
drawn unusually tight on his face, and his eyes were bright and tired.
ÅgShe didnÅft like it,Åh he said immediately.
ÅgOf course she did.Åh
ÅgShe didnÅft like it,Åh he insisted. ÅgShe didnÅft have a good time.Åh
He was silent, and I guessed at his unutterable depression.
ÅgI feel far away from her,Åh he said. ÅgItÅfs hard to make her understand.Åh
ÅgYou mean about the dance?Åh
ÅgThe dance?Åh He dismissed all the dances he had given with a snap of his 
fingers. ÅgOld sport, the dance is unimportant.Åh
He wanted nothing less of Daisy than that she should go to Tom and say: ÅgI never 
loved you.Åh After she had obliterated four years with that sentence they could 
decide upon the more practical measures to be taken. One of them was that, after 
she was free, they were to go back to Louisville and be married from her 
house&#8212;just as if it were five years ago.
ÅgAnd she doesnÅft understand,Åh he said. ÅgShe used to be able to understand. WeÅfd 
sit for hours&#8212;&#8212;Åh
He broke off and began to walk up and down a desolate path of fruit rinds and 
discarded favors and crushed flowers.
ÅgI wouldnÅft ask too much of her,Åh I ventured. ÅgYou canÅft repeat the past.Åh
ÅgCanÅft repeat the past?Åh he cried incredulously. ÅgWhy of course you can!Åh
He looked around him wildly, as if the past were lurking here in the shadow of 
his house, just out of reach of his hand.
ÅgIÅfm going to fix everything just the way it was before,Åh he said, nodding 
determinedly. ÅgSheÅfll see.Åh
He talked a lot about the past, and I gathered that he wanted to recover 
something, some idea of himself perhaps, that had gone into loving Daisy. His 
life had been confused and disordered since then, but if he could once return to 
a certain starting place and go over it all slowly, he could find out what that 
thing was. . . .
. . . One autumn night, five years before, they had been walking down the street 
when the leaves were falling, and they came to a place where there were no trees 
and the sidewalk was white with moonlight. They stopped here and turned toward 
each other. Now it was a cool night with that mysterious excitement in it which 
comes at the two changes of the year. The quiet lights in the houses were 
humming out into the darkness and there was a stir and bustle among the stars. 
Out of the corner of his eye Gatsby saw that the blocks of the sidewalks really 
formed a ladder and mounted to a secret place above the trees&#8212;he could climb to 
it, if he climbed alone, and once there he could suck on the pap of life, gulp 
down the incomparable milk of wonder.
His heart beat faster and faster as DaisyÅfs white face came up to his own. He 
knew that when he kissed this girl, and forever wed his unutterable visions to 
her perishable breath, his mind would never romp again like the mind of God. So 
he waited, listening for a moment longer to the tuning-fork that had been struck 
upon a star. Then he kissed her. At his lipsÅf touch she blossomed for him like a 
flower and the incarnation was complete.
Through all he said, even through his appalling sentimentality, I was reminded 
of something&#8212;an elusive rhythm, a fragment of lost words, that I had heard 
somewhere a long time ago. For a moment a phrase tried to take shape in my mouth 
and my lips parted like a dumb manÅfs, as though there was more struggling upon 
them than a wisp of startled air. But they made no sound, and what I had almost 
remembered was uncommunicable forever.
Chapter 7
It was when curiosity about Gatsby was at its highest that the lights in his 
house failed to go on one Saturday night&#8212;and, as obscurely as it had begun, his 
career as Trimalchio was over. Only gradually did I become aware that the 
automobiles which turned expectantly into his drive stayed for just a minute and 
then drove sulkily away. Wondering if he were sick I went over to find out&#8212;an 
unfamiliar butler with a villainous face squinted at me suspiciously from the 
door.
ÅgIs Mr. Gatsby sick?Åh
ÅgNope.Åh After a pause he added Ågsir.Åh in a dilatory, grudging way.
ÅgI hadnÅft seen him around, and I was rather worried. Tell him Mr. Carraway came 
over.Åh
ÅgWho?Åh he demanded rudely.
ÅgCarraway.Åh
ÅgCarraway. All right, IÅfll tell him.Åh Abruptly he slammed the door.
My Finn informed me that Gatsby had dismissed every servant in his house a week 
ago and replaced them with half a dozen others, who never went into West Egg 
Village to be bribed by the tradesmen, but ordered moderate supplies over the 
telephone. The grocery boy reported that the kitchen looked like a pigsty, and 
the general opinion in the village was that the new people werenÅft servants at 
all.
Next day Gatsby called me on the phone.
ÅgGoing away?Åh I inquired.
ÅgNo, old sport.Åh
ÅgI hear you fired all your servants.Åh
ÅgI wanted somebody who wouldnÅft gossip. Daisy comes over quite often&#8212;in the 
afternoons.Åh
So the whole caravansary had fallen in like a card house at the disapproval in 
her eyes.
ÅgTheyÅfre some people Wolfshiem wanted to do something for. TheyÅfre all brothers 
and sisters. They used to run a small hotel.Åh
ÅgI see.Åh
He was calling up at DaisyÅfs request&#8212;would I come to lunch at her house 
to-morrow? Miss Baker would be there. Half an hour later Daisy herself 
telephoned and seemed relieved to find that I was coming. Something was up. And 
yet I couldnÅft believe that they would choose this occasion for a 
scene&#8212;especially for the rather harrowing scene that Gatsby had outlined in the 
garden.
The next day was broiling, almost the last, certainly the warmest, of the 
summer. As my train emerged from the tunnel into sunlight, only the hot whistles 
of the National Biscuit Company broke the simmering hush at noon. The straw 
seats of the car hovered on the edge of combustion; the woman next to me 
perspired delicately for a while into her white shirtwaist, and then, as her 
newspaper dampened under her fingers, lapsed despairingly into deep heat with a 
desolate cry. Her pocket-book slapped to the floor.
ÅgOh, my!Åh she gasped.
I picked it up with a weary bend and handed it back to her, holding it at armÅfs 
length and by the extreme tip of the corners to indicate that I had no designs 
upon it&#8212;but every one near by, including the woman, suspected me just the same.
ÅgHot!Åh said the conductor to familiar faces. ÅgSome weather! hot! hot! hot! Is it 
hot enough for you? Is it hot? Is it . . . ?Åh
My commutation ticket came back to me with a dark stain from his hand. That any 
one should care in this heat whose flushed lips he kissed, whose head made damp 
the pajama pocket over his heart!
. . . Through the hall of the BuchanansÅf house blew a faint wind, carrying the 
sound of the telephone bell out to Gatsby and me as we waited at the door.
ÅgThe masterÅfs body!Åh roared the butler into the mouthpiece. ÅgIÅfm sorry, madame, 
but we canÅft furnish it&#8212;itÅfs far too hot to touch this noon!Åh
What he really said was: ÅgYes . . . yes . . . IÅfll see.Åh
He set down the receiver and came toward us, glistening slightly, to take our 
stiff straw hats.
ÅgMadame expects you in the salon!Åh he cried, needlessly indicating the 
direction. In this heat every extra gesture was an affront to the common store 
of life.
The room, shadowed well with awnings, was dark and cool. Daisy and Jordan lay 
upon an enormous couch, like silver idols weighing down their own white dresses 
against the singing breeze of the fans.
ÅgWe canÅft move,Åh they said together.
JordanÅfs fingers, powdered white over their tan, rested for a moment in mine.
ÅgAnd Mr. Thomas Buchanan, the athlete?Åh I inquired.
Simultaneously I heard his voice, gruff, muffled, husky, at the hall telephone.
Gatsby stood in the centre of the crimson carpet and gazed around with 
fascinated eyes. Daisy watched him and laughed, her sweet, exciting laugh; a 
tiny gust of powder rose from her bosom into the air.
ÅgThe rumor is,Åh whispered Jordan, Ågthat thatÅfs TomÅfs girl on the telephone.Åh
We were silent. The voice in the hall rose high with annoyance: ÅgVery well, 
then, I wonÅft sell you the car at all. . . . IÅfm under no obligations to you at 
all . . . and as for your bothering me about it at lunch time, I wonÅft stand 
that at all!Åh
ÅgHolding down the receiver,Åh said Daisy cynically.
ÅgNo, heÅfs not,Åh I assured her. ÅgItÅfs a bona-fide deal. I happen to know about 
it.Åh
Tom flung open the door, blocked out its space for a moment with his thick body, 
and hurried into the room.
ÅgMr. Gatsby!Åh He put out his broad, flat hand with well-concealed dislike. ÅgIÅfm 
glad to see you, sir. . . . Nick. . . .Åh
ÅgMake us a cold drink,Åh cried Daisy.
As he left the room again she got up and went over to Gatsby and pulled his face 
down, kissing him on the mouth.
ÅgYou know I love you,Åh she murmured.
ÅgYou forget thereÅfs a lady present,Åh said Jordan.
Daisy looked around doubtfully.
ÅgYou kiss Nick too.Åh
ÅgWhat a low, vulgar girl!Åh
ÅgI donÅft care!Åh cried Daisy, and began to clog on the brick fireplace. Then she 
remembered the heat and sat down guiltily on the couch just as a freshly 
laundered nurse leading a little girl came into the room.
ÅgBles-sed pre-cious,Åh she crooned, holding out her arms. ÅgCome to your own 
mother that loves you.Åh
The child, relinquished by the nurse, rushed across the room and rooted shyly 
into her motherÅfs dress.
ÅgThe bles-sed pre-cious! Did mother get powder on your old yellowy hair? Stand 
up now, and say&#8212;How-de-do.Åh
Gatsby and I in turn leaned down and took the small, reluctant hand. Afterward 
he kept looking at the child with surprise. I donÅft think he had ever really 
believed in its existence before.
ÅgI got dressed before luncheon,Åh said the child, turning eagerly to Daisy.
ÅgThatÅfs because your mother wanted to show you off.Åh Her face bent into the 
single wrinkle of the small, white neck. ÅgYou dream, you. You absolute little 
dream.Åh
ÅgYes,Åh admitted the child calmly. ÅgAunt JordanÅfs got on a white dress too.Åh
ÅgHow do you like motherÅfs friends?Åh Daisy turned her around so that she faced 
Gatsby. ÅgDo you think theyÅfre pretty?Åh
ÅgWhereÅfs Daddy?Åh
ÅgShe doesnÅft look like her father,Åh explained Daisy. ÅgShe looks like me. SheÅfs 
got my hair and shape of the face.Åh
Daisy sat back upon the couch. The nurse took a step forward and held out her 
hand.
ÅgCome, Pammy.Åh
ÅgGood-by, sweetheart!Åh
With a reluctant backward glance the well-disciplined child held to her nurseÅfs 
hand and was pulled out the door, just as Tom came back, preceding four gin 
rickeys that clicked full of ice.
Gatsby took up his drink.
ÅgThey certainly look cool,Åh he said, with visible tension.
We drank in long, greedy swallows.
ÅgI read somewhere that the sunÅfs getting hotter every year,Åh said Tom genially. 
ÅgIt seems that pretty soon the earthÅfs going to fall into the sun&#8212;or wait a 
minute&#8212;itÅfs just the opposite&#8212;the sunÅfs getting colder every year.
ÅgCome outside,Åh he suggested to Gatsby, ÅgIÅfd like you to have a look at the 
place.Åh
I went with them out to the veranda. On the green Sound, stagnant in the heat, 
one small sail crawled slowly toward the fresher sea. GatsbyÅfs eyes followed it 
momentarily; he raised his hand and pointed across the bay.
ÅgIÅfm right across from you.Åh
ÅgSo you are.Åh
Our eyes lifted over the rose-beds and the hot lawn and the weedy refuse of the 
dog-days along-shore. Slowly the white wings of the boat moved against the blue 
cool limit of the sky. Ahead lay the scalloped ocean and the abounding blessed 
isles.
ÅgThereÅfs sport for you,Åh said Tom, nodding. ÅgIÅfd like to be out there with him 
for about an hour.Åh
We had luncheon in the dining-room, darkened too against the heat, and drank 
down nervous gayety with the cold ale.
ÅgWhatÅfll we do with ourselves this afternoon?Åh cried Daisy, Ågand the day after 
that, and the next thirty years?Åh
ÅgDonÅft be morbid,Åh Jordan said. ÅgLife starts all over again when it gets crisp 
in the fall.Åh
ÅgBut itÅfs so hot,Åh insisted Daisy, on the verge of tears, Ågand everythingÅfs so 
confused. LetÅfs all go to town!Åh
Her voice struggled on through the heat, beating against it, molding its 
senselessness into forms.
ÅgIÅfve heard of making a garage out of a stable,Åh Tom was saying to Gatsby, Ågbut 
IÅfm the first man who ever made a stable out of a garage.Åh
ÅgWho wants to go to town?Åh demanded Daisy insistently. GatsbyÅfs eyes floated 
toward her. ÅgAh,Åh she cried, Ågyou look so cool.Åh
Their eyes met, and they stared together at each other, alone in space. With an 
effort she glanced down at the table.
ÅgYou always look so cool,Åh she repeated.
She had told him that she loved him, and Tom Buchanan saw. He was astounded. His 
mouth opened a little, and he looked at Gatsby, and then back at Daisy as if he 
had just recognized her as some one he knew a long time ago.
ÅgYou resemble the advertisement of the man,Åh she went on innocently. ÅgYou know 
the advertisement of the man&#8212;&#8212;Åh
ÅgAll right,Åh broke in Tom quickly, ÅgIÅfm perfectly willing to go to town. Come 
on&#8212;weÅfre all going to town.Åh
He got up, his eyes still flashing between Gatsby and his wife. No one moved.
ÅgCome on!Åh His temper cracked a little. ÅgWhatÅfs the matter, anyhow? If weÅfre 
going to town, letÅfs start.Åh
His hand, trembling with his effort at self-control, bore to his lips the last 
of his glass of ale. DaisyÅfs voice got us to our feet and out on to the blazing 
gravel drive.
ÅgAre we just going to go?Åh she objected. ÅgLike this? ArenÅft we going to let any 
one smoke a cigarette first?Åh
ÅgEverybody smoked all through lunch.Åh
ÅgOh, letÅfs have fun,Åh she begged him. ÅgItÅfs too hot to fuss.Åh He didnÅft answer.
ÅgHave it your own way,Åh she said. ÅgCome on, Jordan.Åh
They went up-stairs to get ready while we three men stood there shuffling the 
hot pebbles with our feet. A silver curve of the moon hovered already in the 
western sky. Gatsby started to speak, changed his mind, but not before Tom 
wheeled and faced him expectantly.
ÅgHave you got your stables here?Åh asked Gatsby with an effort.
ÅgAbout a quarter of a mile down the road.Åh
ÅgOh.Åh
A pause.
ÅgI donÅft see the idea of going to town,Åh broke out Tom savagely. ÅgWomen get 
these notions in their heads&#8212;&#8212;Åh
ÅgShall we take anything to drink?Åh called Daisy from an upper window.
ÅgIÅfll get some whiskey,Åh answered Tom. He went inside.
Gatsby turned to me rigidly:
ÅgI canÅft say anything in his house, old sport.Åh
ÅgSheÅfs got an indiscreet voice,Åh I remarked. ÅgItÅfs full of&#8212;&#8212;Åh I hesitated.
ÅgHer voice is full of money,Åh he said suddenly.
That was it. IÅfd never understood before. It was full of money&#8212;that was the 
inexhaustible charm that rose and fell in it, the jingle of it, the cymbalsÅf 
song of it. . . . high in a white palace the kingÅfs daughter, the golden girl. . 
. .
Tom came out of the house wrapping a quart bottle in a towel, followed by Daisy 
and Jordan wearing small tight hats of metallic cloth and carrying light capes 
over their arms.
ÅgShall we all go in my car?Åh suggested Gatsby. He felt the hot, green leather of 
the seat. ÅgI ought to have left it in the shade.Åh
ÅgIs it standard shift?Åh demanded Tom.
ÅgYes.Åh
ÅgWell, you take my coupe and let me drive your car to town.Åh
The suggestion was distasteful to Gatsby.
ÅgI donÅft think thereÅfs much gas,Åh he objected.
ÅgPlenty of gas,Åh said Tom boisterously. He looked at the gauge. ÅgAnd if it runs 
out I can stop at a drug-store. You can buy anything at a drug-store nowadays.Åh
A pause followed this apparently pointless remark. Daisy looked at Tom frowning, 
and an indefinable expression, at once definitely unfamiliar and vaguely 
recognizable, as if I had only heard it described in words, passed over GatsbyÅfs 
face.
ÅgCome on, Daisy,Åh said Tom, pressing her with his hand toward GatsbyÅfs car. 
ÅgIÅfll take you in this circus wagon.Åh
He opened the door, but she moved out from the circle of his arm.
ÅgYou take Nick and Jordan. WeÅfll follow you in the coupe.Åh
She walked close to Gatsby, touching his coat with her hand. Jordan and Tom and 
I got into the front seat of GatsbyÅfs car, Tom pushed the unfamiliar gears 
tentatively, and we shot off into the oppressive heat, leaving them out of sight 
behind.
ÅgDid you see that?Åh demanded Tom.
ÅgSee what?Åh
He looked at me keenly, realizing that Jordan and I must have known all along.
ÅgYou think IÅfm pretty dumb, donÅft you?Åh he suggested. ÅgPerhaps I am, but I have 
a&#8212;almost a second sight, sometimes, that tells me what to do. Maybe you donÅft 
believe that, but science&#8212;&#8212;Åh
He paused. The immediate contingency overtook him, pulled him back from the edge 
of the theoretical abyss.
ÅgIÅfve made a small investigation of this fellow,Åh he continued. ÅgI could have 
gone deeper if IÅfd known&#8212;&#8212;Åh
ÅgDo you mean youÅfve been to a medium?Åh inquired Jordan humorously.
ÅgWhat?Åh Confused, he stared at us as we laughed. ÅgA medium?Åh
ÅgAbout Gatsby.Åh
ÅgAbout Gatsby! No, I havenÅft. I said IÅfd been making a small investigation of 
his past.Åh
ÅgAnd you found he was an Oxford man,Åh said Jordan helpfully.
ÅgAn Oxford man!Åh He was incredulous. ÅgLike hell he is! He wears a pink suit.Åh
ÅgNevertheless heÅfs an Oxford man.Åh
ÅgOxford, New Mexico,Åh snorted Tom contemptuously, Ågor something like that.Åh
ÅgListen, Tom. If youÅfre such a snob, why did you invite him to lunch?Åh demanded 
Jordan crossly.
ÅgDaisy invited him; she knew him before we were married&#8212;God knows where!Åh
We were all irritable now with the fading ale, and aware of it we drove for a 
while in silence. Then as Doctor T. J. EckleburgÅfs faded eyes came into sight 
down the road, I remembered GatsbyÅfs caution about gasoline.
ÅgWeÅfve got enough to get us to town,Åh said Tom.
ÅgBut thereÅfs a garage right here,Åh objected Jordan. ÅgI donÅft want to get stalled 
in this baking heat.Åh Tom threw on both brakes impatiently, and we slid to an 
abrupt dusty stop under WilsonÅfs sign. After a moment the proprietor emerged 
from the interior of his establishment and gazed hollow-eyed at the car.
ÅgLetÅfs have some gas!Åh cried Tom roughly. ÅgWhat do you think we stopped for&#8212;to 
admire the view?Åh
ÅgIÅfm sick,Åh said Wilson without moving. ÅgBeen sick all day.Åh
ÅgWhatÅfs the matter?Åh
ÅgIÅfm all run down.Åh
ÅgWell, shall I help myself?Åh Tom demanded. ÅgYou sounded well enough on the 
phone.Åh
With an effort Wilson left the shade and support of the doorway and, breathing 
hard, unscrewed the cap of the tank. In the sunlight his face was green.
ÅgI didnÅft mean to interrupt your lunch,Åh he said. ÅgBut I need money pretty bad, 
and I was wondering what you were going to do with your old car.Åh
ÅgHow do you like this one?Åh inquired Tom. ÅgI bought it last week.Åh
ÅgItÅfs a nice yellow one,Åh said Wilson, as he strained at the handle.
ÅgLike to buy it?Åh
ÅgBig chance,Åh Wilson smiled faintly. ÅgNo, but I could make some money on the 
other.Åh
ÅgWhat do you want money for, all of a sudden?Åh
ÅgIÅfve been here too long. I want to get away. My wife and I want to go West.Åh
ÅgYour wife does,Åh exclaimed Tom, startled.
ÅgSheÅfs been talking about it for ten years.Åh He rested for a moment against the 
pump, shading his eyes. ÅgAnd now sheÅfs going whether she wants to or not. IÅfm 
going to get her away.Åh
The coupe flashed by us with a flurry of dust and the flash of a waving hand.
ÅgWhat do I owe you?Åh demanded Tom harshly.
ÅgI just got wised up to something funny the last two days,Åh remarked Wilson. 
ÅgThatÅfs why I want to get away. ThatÅfs why I been bothering you about the car.Åh
ÅgWhat do I owe you?Åh
ÅgDollar twenty.Åh
The relentless beating heat was beginning to confuse me and I had a bad moment 
there before I realized that so far his suspicions hadnÅft alighted on Tom. He 
had discovered that Myrtle had some sort of life apart from him in another 
world, and the shock had made him physically sick. I stared at him and then at 
Tom, who had made a parallel discovery less than an hour before&#8212;and it occurred 
to me that there was no difference between men, in intelligence or race, so 
profound as the difference between the sick and the well. Wilson was so sick 
that he looked guilty, unforgivably guilty&#8212;as if he had just got some poor girl 
with child.
ÅgIÅfll let you have that car,Åh said Tom. ÅgIÅfll send it over to-morrow afternoon.Åh
That locality was always vaguely disquieting, even in the broad glare of 
afternoon, and now I turned my head as though I had been warned of something 
behind. Over the ashheaps the giant eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg kept their 
vigil, but I perceived, after a moment, that other eyes were regarding us with 
peculiar intensity from less than twenty feet away.
In one of the windows over the garage the curtains had been moved aside a 
little, and Myrtle Wilson was peering down at the car. So engrossed was she that 
she had no consciousness of being observed, and one emotion after another crept 
into her face like objects into a slowly developing picture. Her expression was 
curiously familiar&#8212;it was an expression I had often seen on womenÅfs faces, but 
on Myrtle WilsonÅfs face it seemed purposeless and inexplicable until I realized 
that her eyes, wide with jealous terror, were fixed not on Tom, but on Jordan 
Baker, whom she took to be his wife.
There is no confusion like the confusion of a simple mind, and as we drove away 
Tom was feeling the hot whips of panic. His wife and his mistress, until an hour 
ago secure and inviolate, were slipping precipitately from his control. Instinct 
made him step on the accelerator with the double purpose of overtaking Daisy and 
leaving Wilson behind, and we sped along toward Astoria at fifty miles an hour, 
until, among the spidery girders of the elevated, we came in sight of the 
easy-going blue coupe.
ÅgThose big movies around Fiftieth Street are cool,Åh suggested Jordan. ÅgI love 
New York on summer afternoons when every oneÅfs away. ThereÅfs something very 
sensuous about it&#8212;overripe, as if all sorts of funny fruits were going to fall 
into your hands.Åh
The word ÅgsensuousÅh had the effect of further disquieting Tom, but before he 
could invent a protest the coupe came to a stop, and Daisy signaled us to draw 
up alongside.
ÅgWhere are we going?Åh she cried.
ÅgHow about the movies?Åh
ÅgItÅfs so hot,Åh she complained. ÅgYou go. WeÅfll ride around and meet you after.Åh 
With an effort her wit rose faintly, ÅgWeÅfll meet you on some corner. IÅfll be the 
man smoking two cigarettes.Åh
ÅgWe canÅft argue about it here,Åh Tom said impatiently, as a truck gave out a 
cursing whistle behind us. ÅgYou follow me to the south side of Central Park, in 
front of the Plaza.Åh
Several times he turned his head and looked back for their car, and if the 
traffic delayed them he slowed up until they came into sight. I think he was 
afraid they would dart down a side street and out of his life forever.
But they didnÅft. And we all took the less explicable step of engaging the parlor 
of a suite in the Plaza Hotel.
The prolonged and tumultuous argument that ended by herding us into that room 
eludes me, though I have a sharp physical memory that, in the course of it, my 
underwear kept climbing like a damp snake around my legs and intermittent beads 
of sweat raced cool across my back. The notion originated with DaisyÅfs 
suggestion that we hire five bath-rooms and take cold baths, and then assumed 
more tangible form as Åga place to have a mint julep.Åh Each of us said over and 
over that it was a Ågcrazy idea.Åh&#8212;we all talked at once to a baffled clerk and 
thought, or pretended to think, that we were being very funny. . . .
The room was large and stifling, and, though it was already four oÅfclock, 
opening the windows admitted Only a gust of hot shrubbery from the Park. Daisy 
went to the mirror and stood with her back to us, fixing her hair.
ÅgItÅfs a swell suite,Åh whispered Jordan respectfully, and every one laughed.
ÅgOpen another window,Åh commanded Daisy, without turning around.
ÅgThere arenÅft any more.Åh
ÅgWell, weÅfd better telephone for an axe&#8212;&#8212;Åh
ÅgThe thing to do is to forget about the heat,Åh said Tom impatiently. ÅgYou make 
it ten times worse by crabbing about it.Åh
He unrolled the bottle of whiskey from the towel and put it on the table.
ÅgWhy not let her alone, old sport?Åh remarked Gatsby. ÅgYouÅfre the one that wanted 
to come to town.Åh
There was a moment of silence. The telephone book slipped from its nail and 
splashed to the floor, whereupon Jordan whispered, ÅgExcuse me.Åh&#8212;but this time no 
one laughed.
ÅgIÅfll pick it up,Åh I offered.
ÅgIÅfve got it.Åh Gatsby examined the parted string, muttered ÅgHum!Åh in an 
interested way, and tossed the book on a chair.
ÅgThatÅfs a great expression of yours, isnÅft it?Åh said Tom sharply.
ÅgWhat is?Åh
ÅgAll this Åeold sportÅf business. WhereÅfd you pick that up?Åh
ÅgNow see here, Tom,Åh said Daisy, turning around from the mirror, Ågif youÅfre 
going to make personal remarks I wonÅft stay here a minute. Call up and order 
some ice for the mint julep.Åh
As Tom took up the receiver the compressed heat exploded into sound and we were 
listening to the portentous chords of MendelssohnÅfs Wedding March from the 
ballroom below.
ÅgImagine marrying anybody in this heat!Åh cried Jordan dismally.
ÅgStill&#8212;I was married in the middle of June,Åh Daisy remembered, ÅgLouisville in 
June! Somebody fainted. Who was it fainted, Tom?Åh
ÅgBiloxi,Åh he answered shortly.
ÅgA man named Biloxi. ÅeblocksÅf Biloxi, and he made boxes&#8212;thatÅfs a fact&#8212;and he was 
from Biloxi, Tennessee.Åh
ÅgThey carried him into my house,Åh appended Jordan, Ågbecause we lived just two 
doors from the church. And he stayed three weeks, until Daddy told him he had to 
get out. The day after he left Daddy died.Åh After a moment she added as if she 
might have sounded irreverent, ÅgThere wasnÅft any connection.Åh
ÅgI used to know a Bill Biloxi from Memphis,Åh I remarked.
ÅgThat was his cousin. I knew his whole family history before he left. He gave me 
an aluminum putter that I use to-day.Åh
The music had died down as the ceremony began and now a long cheer floated in at 
the window, followed by intermittent cries of ÅgYea-ea-ea!Åh and finally by a 
burst of jazz as the dancing began.
ÅgWeÅfre getting old,Åh said Daisy. ÅgIf we were young weÅfd rise and dance.Åh
ÅgRemember Biloxi,Åh Jordan warned her. ÅgWhereÅfd you know him, Tom?Åh
ÅgBiloxi?Åh He concentrated with an effort. ÅgI didnÅft know him. He was a friend of 
DaisyÅfs.Åh
ÅgHe was not,Åh she denied. ÅgIÅfd never seen him before. He came down in the 
private car.Åh
ÅgWell, he said he knew you. He said he was raised in Louisville. Asa Bird 
brought him around at the last minute and asked if we had room for him.Åh
Jordan smiled.
ÅgHe was probably bumming his way home. He told me he was president of your class 
at Yale.Åh
Tom and I looked at each other blankly.
ÅgBiloxi?Åh
ÅgFirst place, we didnÅft have any president&#8212;&#8212;Åh
GatsbyÅfs foot beat a short, restless tattoo and Tom eyed him suddenly.
ÅgBy the way, Mr. Gatsby, I understand youÅfre an Oxford man.Åh
ÅgNot exactly.Åh
ÅgOh, yes, I understand you went to Oxford.Åh
ÅgYes&#8212;I went there.Åh
A pause. Then TomÅfs voice, incredulous and insulting: ÅgYou must have gone there 
about the time Biloxi went to New Haven.Åh
Another pause. A waiter knocked and came in with crushed mint and ice but, the 
silence was unbroken by his Ågthank you.Åh and the soft closing of the door. This 
tremendous detail was to be cleared up at last.
ÅgI told you I went there,Åh said Gatsby.
ÅgI heard you, but IÅfd like to know when.Åh
ÅgIt was in nineteen-nineteen, I only stayed five months. ThatÅfs why I canÅft 
really call myself an Oxford man.Åh
Tom glanced around to see if we mirrored his unbelief. But we were all looking 
at Gatsby.
ÅgIt was an opportunity they gave to some of the officers after the Armistice,Åh 
he continued. ÅgWe could go to any of the universities in England or France.Åh
I wanted to get up and slap him on the back. I had one of those renewals of 
complete faith in him that IÅfd experienced before.
Daisy rose, smiling faintly, and went to the table.
ÅgOpen the whiskey, Tom,Åh she ordered, Ågand IÅfll make you a mint julep. Then you 
wonÅft seem so stupid to yourself. . . . Look at the mint!Åh
ÅgWait a minute,Åh snapped Tom, ÅgI want to ask Mr. Gatsby one more question.Åh
ÅgGo on,Åh Gatsby said politely.
ÅgWhat kind of a row are you trying to cause in my house anyhow?Åh
They were out in the open at last and Gatsby was content.
ÅgHe isnÅft causing a row.Åh Daisy looked desperately from one to the other. 
ÅgYouÅfre causing a row. Please have a little self-control.Åh
ÅgSelf-control!Åh Repeated Tom incredulously. ÅgI suppose the latest thing is to 
sit back and let Mr. Nobody from Nowhere make love to your wife. Well, if thatÅfs 
the idea you can count me out. . . . Nowadays people begin by sneering at family 
life and family institutions, and next theyÅfll throw everything overboard and 
have intermarriage between black and white.Åh
Flushed with his impassioned gibberish, he saw himself standing alone on the 
last barrier of civilization.
ÅgWeÅfre all white here,Åh murmured Jordan.
ÅgI know IÅfm not very popular. I donÅft give big parties. I suppose youÅfve got to 
make your house into a pigsty in order to have any friends&#8212;in the modern world.Åh
Angry as I was, as we all were, I was tempted to laugh whenever he opened his 
mouth. The transition from libertine to prig was so complete.
ÅgIÅfve got something to tell YOU, old sport&#8212;&#8212;Åh began Gatsby. But Daisy guessed at 
his intention.
ÅgPlease donÅft!Åh she interrupted helplessly. ÅgPlease letÅfs all go home. Why donÅft 
we all go home?Åh
ÅgThatÅfs a good idea.Åh I got up. ÅgCome on, Tom. Nobody wants a drink.Åh
ÅgI want to know what Mr. Gatsby has to tell me.Åh
ÅgYour wife doesnÅft love you,Åh said Gatsby. ÅgSheÅfs never loved you. She loves 
me.Åh
ÅgYou must be crazy!Åh exclaimed Tom automatically.
Gatsby sprang to his feet, vivid with excitement.
ÅgShe never loved you, do you hear?Åh he cried. ÅgShe only married you because I 
was poor and she was tired of waiting for me. It was a terrible mistake, but in 
her heart she never loved any one except me!Åh
At this point Jordan and I tried to go, but Tom and Gatsby insisted with 
competitive firmness that we remain&#8212;as though neither of them had anything to 
conceal and it would be a privilege to partake vicariously of their emotions.
ÅgSit down, Daisy,Åh TomÅfs voice groped unsuccessfully for the paternal note. 
ÅgWhatÅfs been going on? I want to hear all about it.Åh
ÅgI told you whatÅfs been going on,Åh said Gatsby. ÅgGoing on for five years&#8212;and you 
didnÅft know.Åh
Tom turned to Daisy sharply.
ÅgYouÅfve been seeing this fellow for five years?Åh
ÅgNot seeing,Åh said Gatsby. ÅgNo, we couldnÅft meet. But both of us loved each 
other all that time, old sport, and you didnÅft know. I used to laugh 
sometimes.Åh&#8212;but there was no laughter in his eyes&#8212;&#8212;Åh to think that you didnÅft 
know.Åh
ÅgOh&#8212;thatÅfs all.Åh Tom tapped his thick fingers together like a clergyman and 
leaned back in his chair.
ÅgYouÅfre crazy!Åh he exploded. ÅgI canÅft speak about what happened five years ago, 
because I didnÅft know Daisy then&#8212;and IÅfll be damned if I see how you got within 
a mile of her unless you brought the groceries to the back door. But all the 
rest of thatÅfs a God damned lie. Daisy loved me when she married me and she 
loves me now.Åh
ÅgNo,Åh said Gatsby, shaking his head.
ÅgShe does, though. The trouble is that sometimes she gets foolish ideas in her 
head and doesnÅft know what sheÅfs doing.Åh He nodded sagely. ÅgAnd whatÅfs more, I 
love Daisy too. Once in a while I go off on a spree and make a fool of myself, 
but I always come back, and in my heart I love her all the time.Åh
ÅgYouÅfre revolting,Åh said Daisy. She turned to me, and her voice, dropping an 
octave lower, filled the room with thrilling scorn: ÅgDo you know why we left 
Chicago? IÅfm surprised that they didnÅft treat you to the story of that little 
spree.Åh
Gatsby walked over and stood beside her.
ÅgDaisy, thatÅfs all over now,Åh he said earnestly. ÅgIt doesnÅft matter any more. 
Just tell him the truth&#8212;that you never loved him&#8212;and itÅfs all wiped out 
forever.Åh
She looked at him blindly. ÅgWhy&#8212;how could I love him&#8212;possibly?Åh
ÅgYou never loved him.Åh
She hesitated. Her eyes fell on Jordan and me with a sort of appeal, as though 
she realized at last what she was doing&#8212;and as though she had never, all along, 
intended doing anything at all. But it was done now. It was too late.
ÅgI never loved him,Åh she said, with perceptible reluctance.
ÅgNot at Kapiolani?Åh demanded Tom suddenly.
ÅgNo.Åh
From the ballroom beneath, muffled and suffocating chords were drifting up on 
hot waves of air.
ÅgNot that day I carried you down from the Punch Bowl to keep your shoes dry?Åh 
There was a husky tenderness in his tone. . . . ÅgDaisy?Åh
ÅgPlease donÅft.Åh Her voice was cold, but the rancor was gone from it. She looked 
at Gatsby. ÅgThere, Jay,Åh she said&#8212;but her hand as she tried to light a cigarette 
was trembling. Suddenly she threw the cigarette and the burning match on the 
carpet.
ÅgOh, you want too much!Åh she cried to Gatsby. ÅgI love you now&#8212;isnÅft that enough? 
I canÅft help whatÅfs past.Åh She began to sob helplessly. ÅgI did love him once&#8212;but 
I loved you too.Åh
GatsbyÅfs eyes opened and closed.
ÅgYou loved me TOO?Åh he repeated.
ÅgEven thatÅfs a lie,Åh said Tom savagely. ÅgShe didnÅft know you were alive. 
Why&#8212;thereÅfre things between Daisy and me that youÅfll never know, things that 
neither of us can ever forget.Åh
The words seemed to bite physically into Gatsby.
ÅgI want to speak to Daisy alone,Åh he insisted. ÅgSheÅfs all excited now&#8212;&#8212;Åh
ÅgEven alone I canÅft say I never loved Tom,Åh she admitted in a pitiful voice. ÅgIt 
wouldnÅft be true.Åh
ÅgOf course it wouldnÅft,Åh agreed Tom.
She turned to her husband.
ÅgAs if it mattered to you,Åh she said.
ÅgOf course it matters. IÅfm going to take better care of you from now on.Åh
ÅgYou donÅft understand,Åh said Gatsby, with a touch of panic. ÅgYouÅfre not going to 
take care of her any more.Åh
ÅgIÅfm not?Åh Tom opened his eyes wide and laughed. He could afford to control 
himself now. ÅgWhyÅfs that?Åh
ÅgDaisyÅfs leaving you.Åh
ÅgNonsense.Åh
ÅgI am, though,Åh she said with a visible effort.
ÅgSheÅfs not leaving me!Åh TomÅfs words suddenly leaned down over Gatsby. ÅgCertainly 
not for a common swindler whoÅfd have to steal the ring he put on her finger.Åh
ÅgI wonÅft stand this!Åh cried Daisy. ÅgOh, please letÅfs get out.Åh
ÅgWho are you, anyhow?Åh broke out Tom. ÅgYouÅfre one of that bunch that hangs 
around with Meyer Wolfshiem&#8212;that much I happen to know. IÅfve made a little 
investigation into your affairs&#8212;and IÅfll carry it further to-morrow.Åh
ÅgYou can suit yourself about that, old sport.Åh said Gatsby steadily.
ÅgI found out what your Åedrug-storesÅf were.Åh He turned to us and spoke rapidly. 
ÅgHe and this Wolfshiem bought up a lot of side-street drug-stores here and in 
Chicago and sold grain alcohol over the counter. ThatÅfs one of his little 
stunts. I picked him for a bootlegger the first time I saw him, and I wasnÅft far 
wrong.Åh
ÅgWhat about it?Åh said Gatsby politely. ÅgI guess your friend Walter Chase wasnÅft 
too proud to come in on it.Åh
ÅgAnd you left him in the lurch, didnÅft you? You let him go to jail for a month 
over in New Jersey. God! You ought to hear Walter on the subject of YOU.Åh
ÅgHe came to us dead broke. He was very glad to pick up some money, old sport.Åh
ÅgDonÅft you call me Åeold sportÅf!Åh cried Tom. Gatsby said nothing. ÅgWalter could 
have you up on the betting laws too, but Wolfshiem scared him into shutting his 
mouth.Åh
That unfamiliar yet recognizable look was back again in GatsbyÅfs face.
ÅgThat drug-store business was just small change,Åh continued Tom slowly, Ågbut 
youÅfve got something on now that WalterÅfs afraid to tell me about.Åh
I glanced at Daisy, who was staring terrified between Gatsby and her husband, 
and at Jordan, who had begun to balance an invisible but absorbing object on the 
tip of her chin. Then I turned back to Gatsby&#8212;and was startled at his 
expression. He looked&#8212;and this is said in all contempt for the babbled slander 
of his garden&#8212;as if he had Ågkilled a man.Åh For a moment the set of his face 
could be described in just that fantastic way.
It passed, and he began to talk excitedly to Daisy, denying everything, 
defending his name against accusations that had not been made. But with every 
word she was drawing further and further into herself, so he gave that up, and 
only the dead dream fought on as the afternoon slipped away, trying to touch 
what was no longer tangible, struggling unhappily, undespairingly, toward that 
lost voice across the room.
The voice begged again to go.
ÅgPLEASE, Tom! I canÅft stand this any more.Åh
Her frightened eyes told that whatever intentions, whatever courage, she had 
had, were definitely gone.
ÅgYou two start on home, Daisy,Åh said Tom. ÅgIn Mr. GatsbyÅfs car.Åh
She looked at Tom, alarmed now, but he insisted with magnanimous scorn.
ÅgGo on. He wonÅft annoy you. I think he realizes that his presumptuous little 
flirtation is over.Åh
They were gone, without a word, snapped out, made accidental, isolated, like 
ghosts, even from our pity.
After a moment Tom got up and began wrapping the unopened bottle of whiskey in 
the towel.
ÅgWant any of this stuff? Jordan? . . . Nick?Åh
I didnÅft answer.
ÅgNick?Åh He asked again.
ÅgWhat?Åh
ÅgWant any?Åh
ÅgNo . . . I just remembered that to-dayÅfs my birthday.Åh
I was thirty. Before me stretched the portentous, menacing road of a new decade.
It was seven oÅfclock when we got into the coupe with him and started for Long 
Island. Tom talked incessantly, exulting and laughing, but his voice was as 
remote from Jordan and me as the foreign clamor on the sidewalk or the tumult of 
the elevated overhead. Human sympathy has its limits, and we were content to let 
all their tragic arguments fade with the city lights behind. Thirty&#8212;the promise 
of a decade of loneliness, a thinning list of single men to know, a thinning 
brief-case of enthusiasm, thinning hair. But there was Jordan beside me, who, 
unlike Daisy, was too wise ever to carry well-forgotten dreams from age to age. 
As we passed over the dark bridge her wan face fell lazily against my coatÅfs 
shoulder and the formidable stroke of thirty died away with the reassuring 
pressure of her hand.
So we drove on toward death through the cooling twilight.
The young Greek, Michaelis, who ran the coffee joint beside the ashheaps was the 
principal witness at the inquest. He had slept through the heat until after 
five, when he strolled over to the garage, and found George Wilson sick in his 
office&#8212;really sick, pale as his own pale hair and shaking all over. Michaelis 
advised him to go to bed, but Wilson refused, saying that heÅfd miss a lot of 
business if he did. While his neighbor was trying to persuade him a violent 
racket broke out overhead.
ÅgIÅfve got my wife locked in up there,Åh explained Wilson calmly. ÅgSheÅfs going to 
stay there till the day after to-morrow, and then weÅfre going to move away.Åh
Michaelis was astonished; they had been neighbors for four years, and Wilson had 
never seemed faintly capable of such a statement. Generally he was one of these 
worn-out men: when he wasnÅft working, he sat on a chair in the doorway and 
stared at the people and the cars that passed along the road. When any one spoke 
to him he invariably laughed in an agreeable, colorless way. He was his wifeÅfs 
man and not his own.
So naturally Michaelis tried to find out what had happened, but Wilson wouldnÅft 
say a word&#8212;instead he began to throw curious, suspicious glances at his visitor 
and ask him what heÅfd been doing at certain times on certain days. Just as the 
latter was getting uneasy, some workmen came past the door bound for his 
restaurant, and Michaelis took the opportunity to get away, intending to come 
back later. But he didnÅft. He supposed he forgot to, thatÅfs all. When he came 
outside again, a little after seven, he was reminded of the conversation because 
he heard Mrs. WilsonÅfs voice, loud and scolding, down-stairs in the garage.
ÅgBeat me!Åh he heard her cry. ÅgThrow me down and beat me, you dirty little 
coward!Åh
A moment later she rushed out into the dusk, waving her hands and 
shouting&#8212;before he could move from his door the business was over.
The Ågdeath car.Åh as the newspapers called it, didnÅft stop; it came out of the 
gathering darkness, wavered tragically for a moment, and then disappeared around 
the next bend. Michaelis wasnÅft even sure of its color&#8212;he told the first 
policeman that it was light green. The other car, the one going toward New York, 
came to rest a hundred yards beyond, and its driver hurried back to where Myrtle 
Wilson, her life violently extinguished, knelt in the road and mingled her thick 
dark blood with the dust.
Michaelis and this man reached her first, but when they had torn open her 
shirtwaist, still damp with perspiration, they saw that her left breast was 
swinging loose like a flap, and there was no need to listen for the heart 
beneath. The mouth was wide open and ripped at the corners, as though she had 
choked a little in giving up the tremendous vitality she had stored so long.
We saw the three or four automobiles and the crowd when we were still some 
distance away.
ÅgWreck!Åh said Tom. ÅgThatÅfs good. WilsonÅfll have a little business at last.Åh
He slowed down, but still without any intention of stopping, until, as we came 
nearer, the hushed, intent faces of the people at the garage door made him 
automatically put on the brakes.
ÅgWeÅfll take a look,Åh he said doubtfully, Ågjust a look.Åh
I became aware now of a hollow, wailing sound which issued incessantly from the 
garage, a sound which as we got out of the coupe and walked toward the door 
resolved itself into the words ÅgOh, my God!Åh uttered over and over in a gasping 
moan.
ÅgThereÅfs some bad trouble here,Åh said Tom excitedly.
He reached up on tiptoes and peered over a circle of heads into the garage, 
which was lit only by a yellow light in a swinging wire basket overhead. Then he 
made a harsh sound in his throat, and with a violent thrusting movement of his 
powerful arms pushed his way through.
The circle closed up again with a running murmur of expostulation; it was a 
minute before I could see anything at all. Then new arrivals deranged the line, 
and Jordan and I were pushed suddenly inside.
Myrtle WilsonÅfs body, wrapped in a blanket, and then in another blanket, as 
though she suffered from a chill in the hot night, lay on a work-table by the 
wall, and Tom, with his back to us, was bending over it, motionless. Next to him 
stood a motorcycle policeman taking down names with much sweat and correction in 
a little book. At first I couldnÅft find the source of the high, groaning words 
that echoed clamorously through the bare garage&#8212;then I saw Wilson standing on 
the raised threshold of his office, swaying back and forth and holding to the 
doorposts with both hands. Some man was talking to him in a low voice and 
attempting, from time to time, to lay a hand on his shoulder, but Wilson neither 
heard nor saw. His eyes would drop slowly from the swinging light to the laden 
table by the wall, and then jerk back to the light again, and he gave out 
incessantly his high, horrible call:
ÅgOh, my Ga-od! Oh, my Ga-od! oh, Ga-od! oh, my Ga-od!Åh
Presently Tom lifted his head with a jerk and, after staring around the garage 
with glazed eyes, addressed a mumbled incoherent remark to the policeman.
ÅgM-a-y-.Åh the policeman was saying, Åg-o&#8212;&#8212;Åh
ÅgNo, r-.Åh corrected the man, ÅgM-a-v-r-o&#8212;&#8212;Åh
ÅgListen to me!Åh muttered Tom fiercely.
ÅgrÅh said the policeman, Ågo&#8212;&#8212;Åh
Ågg&#8212;&#8212;Åh
Ågg&#8212;&#8212;Åh He looked up as TomÅfs broad hand fell sharply on his shoulder. ÅgWhat you 
want, fella?Åh
ÅgWhat happened?&#8212;thatÅfs what I want to know.Åh
ÅgAuto hit her. InsÅfantly killed.Åh
ÅgInstantly killed,Åh repeated Tom, staring.
ÅgShe ran out ina road. Son-of-a-bitch didnÅft even stopus car.Åh
ÅgThere was two cars,Åh said Michaelis, Ågone cominÅf, one goinÅf, see?Åh
ÅgGoing where?Åh asked the policeman keenly.
ÅgOne goinÅf each way. Well, she.Åh&#8212;his hand rose toward the blankets but stopped 
half way and fell to his side&#8212;&#8212;Åh she ran out there anÅf the one cominÅf from 
NÅfyork knock right into her, goinÅf thirty or forty miles an hour.Åh
ÅgWhatÅfs the name of this place here?Åh demanded the officer.
ÅgHasnÅft got any name.Åh
A pale well-dressed negro stepped near.
ÅgIt was a yellow car,Åh he said, Ågbig yellow car. New.Åh
ÅgSee the accident?Åh asked the policeman.
ÅgNo, but the car passed me down the road, going fasterÅfn forty. Going fifty, 
sixty.Åh
ÅgCome here and letÅfs have your name. Look out now. I want to get his name.Åh
Some words of this conversation must have reached Wilson, swaying in the office 
door, for suddenly a new theme found voice among his gasping cries:
ÅgYou donÅft have to tell me what kind of car it was! I know what kind of car it 
was!Åh
Watching Tom, I saw the wad of muscle back of his shoulder tighten under his 
coat. He walked quickly over to Wilson and, standing in front of him, seized him 
firmly by the upper arms.
ÅgYouÅfve got to pull yourself together,Åh he said with soothing gruffness.
WilsonÅfs eyes fell upon Tom; he started up on his tiptoes and then would have 
collapsed to his knees had not Tom held him upright.
ÅgListen,Åh said Tom, shaking him a little. ÅgI just got here a minute ago, from 
New York. I was bringing you that coupe weÅfve been talking about. That yellow 
car I was driving this afternoon wasnÅft mine&#8212;do you hear? I havenÅft seen it all 
afternoon.Åh
Only the negro and I were near enough to hear what he said, but the policeman 
caught something in the tone and looked over with truculent eyes.
ÅgWhatÅfs all that?Åh he demanded.
ÅgIÅfm a friend of his.Åh Tom turned his head but kept his hands firm on WilsonÅfs 
body. ÅgHe says he knows the car that did it . . . it was a yellow car.Åh
Some dim impulse moved the policeman to look suspiciously at Tom.
ÅgAnd what colorÅfs your car?Åh
ÅgItÅfs a blue car, a coupe.Åh
ÅgWeÅfve come straight from New York,Åh I said.
Some one who had been driving a little behind us confirmed this, and the 
policeman turned away.
ÅgNow, if youÅfll let me have that name again correct&#8212;&#8212;Åh Picking up Wilson like a 
doll, Tom carried him into the office, set him down in a chair, and came back.
ÅgIf somebodyÅfll come here and sit with him,Åh he snapped authoritatively. He 
watched while the two men standing closest glanced at each other and went 
unwillingly into the room. Then Tom shut the door on them and came down the 
single step, his eyes avoiding the table. As he passed close to me he whispered: 
ÅgLetÅfs get out.Åh
Self-consciously, with his authoritative arms breaking the way, we pushed 
through the still gathering crowd, passing a hurried doctor, case in hand, who 
had been sent for in wild hope half an hour ago.
Tom drove slowly until we were beyond the bend&#8212;then his foot came down hard, and 
the coupe raced along through the night. In a little while I heard a low husky 
sob, and saw that the tears were overflowing down his face.
ÅgThe God damned coward!Åh he whimpered. ÅgHe didnÅft even stop his car.Åh
The BuchanansÅf house floated suddenly toward us through the dark rustling trees. 
Tom stopped beside the porch and looked up at the second floor, where two 
windows bloomed with light among the vines.
ÅgDaisyÅfs home,Åh he said. As we got out of the car he glanced at me and frowned 
slightly.
ÅgI ought to have dropped you in West Egg, Nick. ThereÅfs nothing we can do 
to-night.Åh
A change had come over him, and he spoke gravely, and with decision. As we 
walked across the moonlight gravel to the porch he disposed of the situation in 
a few brisk phrases.
ÅgIÅfll telephone for a taxi to take you home, and while youÅfre waiting you and 
Jordan better go in the kitchen and have them get you some supper&#8212;if you want 
any.Åh He opened the door. ÅgCome in.Åh
ÅgNo, thanks. But IÅfd be glad if youÅfd order me the taxi. IÅfll wait outside.Åh
Jordan put her hand on my arm.
ÅgWonÅft you come in, Nick?Åh
ÅgNo, thanks.Åh
I was feeling a little sick and I wanted to be alone. But Jordan lingered for a 
moment more.
ÅgItÅfs only half-past nine,Åh she said.
IÅfd be damned if IÅfd go in; IÅfd had enough of all of them for one day, and 
suddenly that included Jordan too. She must have seen something of this in my 
expression, for she turned abruptly away and ran up the porch steps into the 
house. I sat down for a few minutes with my head in my hands, until I heard the 
phone taken up inside and the butlerÅfs voice calling a taxi. Then I walked 
slowly down the drive away from the house, intending to wait by the gate.
I hadnÅft gone twenty yards when I heard my name and Gatsby stepped from between 
two bushes into the path. I must have felt pretty weird by that time, because I 
could think of nothing except the luminosity of his pink suit under the moon.
ÅgWhat are you doing?Åh I inquired.
ÅgJust standing here, old sport.Åh
Somehow, that seemed a despicable occupation. For all I knew he was going to rob 
the house in a moment; I wouldnÅft have been surprised to see sinister faces, the 
faces of ÅeWolfshiemÅfs people,Åf behind him in the dark shrubbery.
ÅgDid you see any trouble on the road?Åh he asked after a minute.
ÅgYes.Åh
He hesitated.
ÅgWas she killed?Åh
ÅgYes.Åh
ÅgI thought so; I told Daisy I thought so. ItÅfs better that the shock should all 
come at once. She stood it pretty well.Åh
He spoke as if DaisyÅfs reaction was the only thing that mattered.
ÅgI got to West Egg by a side road,Åh he went on, Ågand left the car in my garage. 
I donÅft think anybody saw us, but of course I canÅft be sure.Åh
I disliked him so much by this time that I didnÅft find it necessary to tell him 
he was wrong.
ÅgWho was the woman?Åh he inquired.
ÅgHer name was Wilson. Her husband owns the garage. How the devil did it happen?Åh
ÅgWell, I tried to swing the wheel&#8212;&#8212;Åh He broke off, and suddenly I guessed at the 
truth.
ÅgWas Daisy driving?Åh
ÅgYes,Åh he said after a moment, Ågbut of course IÅfll say I was. You see, when we 
left New York she was very nervous and she thought it would steady her to 
drive&#8212;and this woman rushed out at us just as we were passing a car coming the 
other way. It all happened in a minute, but it seemed to me that she wanted to 
speak to us, thought we were somebody she knew. Well, first Daisy turned away 
from the woman toward the other car, and then she lost her nerve and turned 
back. The second my hand reached the wheel I felt the shock&#8212;it must have killed 
her instantly.Åh
ÅgIt ripped her open&#8212;&#8212;Åh
ÅgDonÅft tell me, old sport.Åh He winced. ÅgAnyhow&#8212;Daisy stepped on it. I tried to 
make her stop, but she couldnÅft, so I pulled on the emergency brake. Then she 
fell over into my lap and I drove on.
ÅgSheÅfll be all right to-morrow,Åh he said presently. ÅgIÅfm just going to wait here 
and see if he tries to bother her about that unpleasantness this afternoon. 
SheÅfs locked herself into her room, and if he tries any brutality sheÅfs going to 
turn the light out and on again.Åh
ÅgHe wonÅft touch her,Åf I said. ÅgHeÅfs not thinking about her.Åh
ÅgI donÅft trust him, old sport.Åh
ÅgHow long are you going to wait?Åh
ÅgAll night, if necessary. Anyhow, till they all go to bed.Åh
A new point of view occurred to me. Suppose Tom found out that Daisy had been 
driving. He might think he saw a connection in it&#8212;he might think anything. I 
looked at the house; there were two or three bright windows down-stairs and the 
pink glow from DaisyÅfs room on the second floor.
ÅgYou wait here,Åh I said. ÅgIÅfll see if thereÅfs any sign of a commotion.Åh
I walked back along the border of the lawn, traversed the gravel softly, and 
tiptoed up the veranda steps. The drawing-room curtains were open, and I saw 
that the room was empty. Crossing the porch where we had dined that June night 
three months before, I came to a small rectangle of light which I guessed was 
the pantry window. The blind was drawn, but I found a rift at the sill.
Daisy and Tom were sitting opposite each other at the kitchen table, with a 
plate of cold fried chicken between them, and two bottles of ale. He was talking 
intently across the table at her, and in his earnestness his hand had fallen 
upon and covered her own. Once in a while she looked up at him and nodded in 
agreement.
They werenÅft happy, and neither of them had touched the chicken or the ale&#8212;and 
yet they werenÅft unhappy either. There was an unmistakable air of natural 
intimacy about the picture, and anybody would have said that they were 
conspiring together.
As I tiptoed from the porch I heard my taxi feeling its way along the dark road 
toward the house. Gatsby was waiting where I had left him in the drive.
ÅgIs it all quiet up there?Åh he asked anxiously.
ÅgYes, itÅfs all quiet.Åh I hesitated. ÅgYouÅfd better come home and get some sleep.Åh
He shook his head.
ÅgI want to wait here till Daisy goes to bed. Good night, old sport.Åh
He put his hands in his coat pockets and turned back eagerly to his scrutiny of 
the house, as though my presence marred the sacredness of the vigil. So I walked 
away and left him standing there in the moonlight&#8212;watching over nothing.
Chapter 8
I couldnÅft sleep all night; a fog-horn was groaning incessantly on the Sound, 
and I tossed half-sick between grotesque reality and savage, frightening dreams. 
Toward dawn I heard a taxi go up GatsbyÅfs drive, and immediately I jumped out of 
bed and began to dress&#8212;I felt that I had something to tell him, something to 
warn him about, and morning would be too late.
Crossing his lawn, I saw that his front door was still open and he was leaning 
against a table in the hall, heavy with dejection or sleep.
ÅgNothing happened,Åh he said wanly. ÅgI waited, and about four oÅfclock she came to 
the window and stood there for a minute and then turned out the light.Åh
His house had never seemed so enormous to me as it did that night when we hunted 
through the great rooms for cigarettes. We pushed aside curtains that were like 
pavilions, and felt over innumerable feet of dark wall for electric light 
switches&#8212;once I tumbled with a sort of splash upon the keys of a ghostly piano. 
There was an inexplicable amount of dust everywhere, and the rooms were musty, 
as though they hadnÅft been aired for many days. I found the humidor on an 
unfamiliar table, with two stale, dry cigarettes inside. Throwing open the 
French windows of the drawing-room, we sat smoking out into the darkness.
ÅgYou ought to go away,Åh I said. ÅgItÅfs pretty certain theyÅfll trace your car.Åh
ÅgGo away NOW, old sport?Åh
ÅgGo to Atlantic City for a week, or up to Montreal.Åh
He wouldnÅft consider it. He couldnÅft possibly leave Daisy until he knew what she 
was going to do. He was clutching at some last hope and I couldnÅft bear to shake 
him free.
It was this night that he told me the strange story of his youth with Dan 
Cody&#8212;told it to me because ÅgJay Gatsby.Åh had broken up like glass against TomÅfs 
hard malice, and the long secret extravaganza was played out. I think that he 
would have acknowledged anything now, without reserve, but he wanted to talk 
about Daisy.
She was the first ÅgniceÅh girl he had ever known. In various unrevealed 
capacities he had come in contact with such people, but always with 
indiscernible barbed wire between. He found her excitingly desirable. He went to 
her house, at first with other officers from Camp Taylor, then alone. It amazed 
him&#8212;he had never been in such a beautiful house before. but what gave it an air 
of breathless intensity, was that Daisy lived there&#8212;it was as casual a thing to 
her as his tent out at camp was to him. There was a ripe mystery about it, a 
hint of bedrooms up-stairs more beautiful and cool than other bedrooms, of gay 
and radiant activities taking place through its corridors, and of romances that 
were not musty and laid away already in lavender but fresh and breathing and 
redolent of this yearÅfs shining motor-cars and of dances whose flowers were 
scarcely withered. It excited him, too, that many men had already loved Daisy&#8212;it 
increased her value in his eyes. He felt their presence all about the house, 
pervading the air with the shades and echoes of still vibrant emotions.
But he knew that he was in DaisyÅfs house by a colossal accident. However 
glorious might be his future as Jay Gatsby, he was at present a penniless young 
man without a past, and at any moment the invisible cloak of his uniform might 
slip from his shoulders. So he made the most of his time. He took what he could 
get, ravenously and unscrupulously&#8212; eventually he took Daisy one still October 
night, took her because he had no real right to touch her hand.
He might have despised himself, for he had certainly taken her under false 
pretenses. I donÅft mean that he had traded on his phantom millions, but he had 
deliberately given Daisy a sense of security; he let her believe that he was a 
person from much the same stratum as herself&#8212;that he was fully able to take care 
of her. As a matter of fact, he had no such facilities&#8212;he had no comfortable 
family standing behind him, and he was liable at the whim of an impersonal 
government to be blown anywhere about the world.
But he didnÅft despise himself and it didnÅft turn out as he had imagined. He had 
intended, probably, to take what he could and go&#8212;but now he found that he had 
committed himself to the following of a grail. He knew that Daisy was 
extraordinary, but he didnÅft realize just how extraordinary a ÅgniceÅh girl could 
be. She vanished into her rich house, into her rich, full life, leaving 
Gatsby&#8212;nothing. He felt married to her, that was all.
When they met again, two days later, it was Gatsby who was breathless, who was, 
somehow, betrayed. Her porch was bright with the bought luxury of star-shine; 
the wicker of the settee squeaked fashionably as she turned toward him and he 
kissed her curious and lovely mouth. She had caught a cold, and it made her 
voice huskier and more charming than ever, and Gatsby was overwhelmingly aware 
of the youth and mystery that wealth imprisons and preserves, of the freshness 
of many clothes, and of Daisy, gleaming like silver, safe and proud above the 
hot struggles of the poor.
ÅgI canÅft describe to you how surprised I was to find out I loved her, old sport. 
I even hoped for a while that sheÅfd throw me over, but she didnÅft, because she 
was in love with me too. She thought I knew a lot because I knew different 
things from her. . . . Well, there I was, Åeway off my ambitions, getting deeper 
in love every minute, and all of a sudden I didnÅft care. What was the use of 
doing great things if I could have a better time telling her what I was going to 
do?Åh On the last afternoon before he went abroad, he sat with Daisy in his arms 
for a long, silent time. It was a cold fall day, with fire in the room and her 
cheeks flushed. Now and then she moved and he changed his arm a little, and once 
he kissed her dark shining hair. The afternoon had made them tranquil for a 
while, as if to give them a deep memory for the long parting the next day 
promised. They had never been closer in their month of love, nor communicated 
more profoundly one with another, than when she brushed silent lips against his 
coatÅfs shoulder or when he touched the end of her fingers, gently, as though she 
were asleep.
He did extraordinarily well in the war. He was a captain before he went to the 
front, and following the Argonne battles he got his majority and the command of 
the divisional machine-guns. After the Armistice he tried frantically to get 
home, but some complication or misunderstanding sent him to Oxford instead. He 
was worried now&#8212;there was a quality of nervous despair in DaisyÅfs letters. She 
didnÅft see why he couldnÅft come. She was feeling the pressure of the world 
outside, and she wanted to see him and feel his presence beside her and be 
reassured that she was doing the right thing after all.
For Daisy was young and her artificial world was redolent of orchids and 
pleasant, cheerful snobbery and orchestras which set the rhythm of the year, 
summing up the sadness and suggestiveness of life in new tunes. All night the 
saxophones wailed the hopeless comment of the BEALE STREET BLUES. while a 
hundred pairs of golden and silver slippers shuffled the shining dust. At the 
gray tea hour there were always rooms that throbbed incessantly with this low, 
sweet fever, while fresh faces drifted here and there like rose petals blown by 
the sad horns around the floor.
Through this twilight universe Daisy began to move again with the season; 
suddenly she was again keeping half a dozen dates a day with half a dozen men, 
and drowsing asleep at dawn with the beads and chiffon of an evening dress 
tangled among dying orchids on the floor beside her bed. And all the time 
something within her was crying for a decision. She wanted her life shaped now, 
immediately&#8212;and the decision must be made by some force&#8212;of love, of money, of 
unquestionable practicality&#8212;that was close at hand.
That force took shape in the middle of spring with the arrival of Tom Buchanan. 
There was a wholesome bulkiness about his person and his position, and Daisy was 
flattered. Doubtless there was a certain struggle and a certain relief. The 
letter reached Gatsby while he was still at Oxford.
It was dawn now on Long Island and we went about opening the rest of the windows 
down-stairs, filling the house with gray-turning, gold-turning light. The shadow 
of a tree fell abruptly across the dew and ghostly birds began to sing among the 
blue leaves. There was a slow, pleasant movement in the air, scarcely a wind, 
promising a cool, lovely day.
ÅgI donÅft think she ever loved him.Åh Gatsby turned around from a window and 
looked at me challengingly. ÅgYou must remember, old sport, she was very excited 
this afternoon. He told her those things in a way that frightened her&#8212;that made 
it look as if I was some kind of cheap sharper. And the result was she hardly 
knew what she was saying.Åh
He sat down gloomily.
ÅgOf course she might have loved him just for a minute, when they were first 
married&#8212;and loved me more even then, do you see?Åh
Suddenly he came out with a curious remark.
ÅgIn any case,Åh he said, Ågit was just personal.Åh
What could you make of that, except to suspect some intensity in his conception 
of the affair that couldnÅft be measured?
He came back from France when Tom and Daisy were still on their wedding trip, 
and made a miserable but irresistible journey to Louisville on the last of his 
army pay. He stayed there a week, walking the streets where their footsteps had 
clicked together through the November night and revisiting the out-of-the-way 
places to which they had driven in her white car. Just as DaisyÅfs house had 
always seemed to him more mysterious and gay than other houses, so his idea of 
the city itself, even though she was gone from it, was pervaded with a 
melancholy beauty.
He left feeling that if he had searched harder, he might have found her&#8212;that he 
was leaving her behind. The day-coach&#8212;he was penniless now&#8212;was hot. He went out 
to the open vestibule and sat down on a folding-chair, and the station slid away 
and the backs of unfamiliar buildings moved by. Then out into the spring fields, 
where a yellow trolley raced them for a minute with people in it who might once 
have seen the pale magic of her face along the casual street.
The track curved and now it was going away from the sun, which as it sank lower, 
seemed to spread itself in benediction over the vanishing city where she had 
drawn her breath. He stretched out his hand desperately as if to snatch only a 
wisp of air, to save a fragment of the spot that she had made lovely for him. 
But it was all going by too fast now for his blurred eyes and he knew that he 
had lost that part of it, the freshest and the best, forever.
It was nine oÅfclock when we finished breakfast and went out on the porch. The 
night had made a sharp difference in the weather and there was an autumn flavor 
in the air. The gardener, the last one of GatsbyÅfs former servants, came to the 
foot of the steps.
ÅgIÅfm going to drain the pool to-day, Mr. Gatsby. LeavesÅfll start falling pretty 
soon, and then thereÅfs always trouble with the pipes.Åh
ÅgDonÅft do it to-day,Åh Gatsby answered. He turned to me apologetically. ÅgYou 
know, old sport, IÅfve never used that pool all summer?Åh
I looked at my watch and stood up.
ÅgTwelve minutes to my train.Åh
I didnÅft want to go to the city. I wasnÅft worth a decent stroke of work, but it 
was more than that&#8212;I didnÅft want to leave Gatsby. I missed that train, and then 
another, before I could get myself away.
ÅgIÅfll call you up,Åh I said finally.
ÅgDo, old sport.Åh
ÅgIÅfll call you about noon.Åh
We walked slowly down the steps.
ÅgI suppose DaisyÅfll call too.Åh He looked at me anxiously, as if he hoped IÅfd 
corroborate this.
ÅgI suppose so.Åh
ÅgWell, good-by.Åh
We shook hands and I started away. Just before I reached the hedge I remembered 
something and turned around.
ÅgTheyÅfre a rotten crowd,Åh I shouted across the lawn. ÅgYouÅfre worth the whole 
damn bunch put together.Åh
IÅfve always been glad I said that. It was the only compliment I ever gave him, 
because I disapproved of him from beginning to end. First he nodded politely, 
and then his face broke into that radiant and understanding smile, as if weÅfd 
been in ecstatic cahoots on that fact all the time. His gorgeous pink rag of a 
suit made a bright spot of color against the white steps, and I thought of the 
night when I first came to his ancestral home, three months before. The lawn and 
drive had been crowded with the faces of those who guessed at his corruption&#8212;and 
he had stood on those steps, concealing his incorruptible dream, as he waved 
them good-by.
I thanked him for his hospitality. We were always thanking him for that&#8212;I and 
the others.
ÅgGood-by,Åh I called. ÅgI enjoyed breakfast, Gatsby.Åh
Up in the city, I tried for a while to list the quotations on an interminable 
amount of stock, then I fell asleep in my swivel-chair. Just before noon the 
phone woke me, and I started up with sweat breaking out on my forehead. It was 
Jordan Baker; she often called me up at this hour because the uncertainty of her 
own movements between hotels and clubs and private houses made her hard to find 
in any other way. Usually her voice came over the wire as something fresh and 
cool, as if a divot from a green golf-links had come sailing in at the office 
window, but this morning it seemed harsh and dry.
ÅgIÅfve left DaisyÅfs house,Åh she said. ÅgIÅfm at Hempstead, and IÅfm going down to 
Southampton this afternoon.Åh
Probably it had been tactful to leave DaisyÅfs house, but the act annoyed me, and 
her next remark made me rigid.
ÅgYou werenÅft so nice to me last night.Åh
ÅgHow could it have mattered then?Åh
Silence for a moment. Then:
ÅgHowever&#8212;I want to see you.Åh
ÅgI want to see you, too.Åh
ÅgSuppose I donÅft go to Southampton, and come into town this afternoon?Åh
ÅgNo&#8212;I donÅft think this afternoon.Åh
ÅgVery well.Åh
ÅgItÅfs impossible this afternoon. Various&#8212;&#8212;Åh
We talked like that for a while, and then abruptly we werenÅft talking any 
longer. I donÅft know which of us hung up with a sharp click, but I know I didnÅft 
care. I couldnÅft have talked to her across a tea-table that day if I never 
talked to her again in this world.
I called GatsbyÅfs house a few minutes later, but the line was busy. I tried four 
times; finally an exasperated central told me the wire was being kept open for 
long distance from Detroit. Taking out my time-table, I drew a small circle 
around the three-fifty train. Then I leaned back in my chair and tried to think. 
It was just noon.
When I passed the ashheaps on the train that morning I had crossed deliberately 
to the other side of the car. I suppose thereÅfd be a curious crowd around there 
all day with little boys searching for dark spots in the dust, and some 
garrulous man telling over and over what had happened, until it became less and 
less real even to him and he could tell it no longer, and Myrtle WilsonÅfs tragic 
achievement was forgotten. Now I want to go back a little and tell what happened 
at the garage after we left there the night before.
They had difficulty in locating the sister, Catherine. She must have broken her 
rule against drinking that night, for when she arrived she was stupid with 
liquor and unable to understand that the ambulance had already gone to Flushing. 
When they convinced her of this, she immediately fainted, as if that was the 
intolerable part of the affair. Some one, kind or curious, took her in his car 
and drove her in the wake of her sisterÅfs body.
Until long after midnight a changing crowd lapped up against the front of the 
garage, while George Wilson rocked himself back and forth on the couch inside. 
For a while the door of the office was open, and every one who came into the 
garage glanced irresistibly through it. Finally someone said it was a shame, and 
closed the door. Michaelis and several other men were with him; first, four or 
five men, later two or three men. Still later Michaelis had to ask the last 
stranger to wait there fifteen minutes longer, while he went back to his own 
place and made a pot of coffee. After that, he stayed there alone with Wilson 
until dawn.
About three oÅfclock the quality of WilsonÅfs incoherent muttering changed&#8212;he grew 
quieter and began to talk about the yellow car. He announced that he had a way 
of finding out whom the yellow car belonged to, and then he blurted out that a 
couple of months ago his wife had come from the city with her face bruised and 
her nose swollen.
But when he heard himself say this, he flinched and began to cry ÅgOh, my God!Åh 
again in his groaning voice. Michaelis made a clumsy attempt to distract him.
ÅgHow long have you been married, George? Come on there, try and sit still a 
minute and answer my question. How long have you been married?Åh
ÅgTwelve years.Åh
ÅgEver had any children? Come on, George, sit still&#8212;I asked you a question. Did 
you ever have any children?Åh
The hard brown beetles kept thudding against the dull light, and whenever 
Michaelis heard a car go tearing along the road outside it sounded to him like 
the car that hadnÅft stopped a few hours before. He didnÅft like to go into the 
garage, because the work bench was stained where the body had been lying, so he 
moved uncomfortably around the office&#8212;he knew every object in it before 
morning&#8212;and from time to time sat down beside Wilson trying to keep him more 
quiet.
ÅgHave you got a church you go to sometimes, George? Maybe even if you havenÅft 
been there for a long time? Maybe I could call up the church and get a priest to 
come over and he could talk to you, see?Åh
ÅgDonÅft belong to any.Åh
ÅgYou ought to have a church, George, for times like this. You must have gone to 
church once. DidnÅft you get married in a church? Listen, George, listen to me. 
DidnÅft you get married in a church?Åh
ÅgThat was a long time ago.Åh
The effort of answering broke the rhythm of his rocking&#8212;for a moment he was 
silent. Then the same half-knowing, half-bewildered look came back into his 
faded eyes.
ÅgLook in the drawer there,Åh he said, pointing at the desk.
ÅgWhich drawer?Åh
ÅgThat drawer&#8212;that one.Åh
Michaelis opened the drawer nearest his hand. There was nothing in it but a 
small, expensive dog-leash, made of leather and braided silver. It was 
apparently new.
ÅgThis?Åh he inquired, holding it up.
Wilson stared and nodded.
ÅgI found it yesterday afternoon. She tried to tell me about it, but I knew it 
was something funny.Åh
ÅgYou mean your wife bought it?Åh
ÅgShe had it wrapped in tissue paper on her bureau.Åh
Michaelis didnÅft see anything odd in that, and he gave Wilson a dozen reasons 
why his wife might have bought the dog-leash. But conceivably Wilson had heard 
some of these same explanations before, from Myrtle, because he began saying 
ÅgOh, my God!Åh again in a whisper&#8212;his comforter left several explanations in the 
air.
ÅgThen he killed her,Åh said Wilson. His mouth dropped open suddenly.
ÅgWho did?Åh
ÅgI have a way of finding out.Åh
ÅgYouÅfre morbid, George,Åh said his friend. ÅgThis has been a strain to you and you 
donÅft know what youÅfre saying. YouÅfd better try and sit quiet till morning.Åh
ÅgHe murdered her.Åh
ÅgIt was an accident, George.Åh
Wilson shook his head. His eyes narrowed and his mouth widened slightly with the 
ghost of a superior ÅgHm!Åh
ÅgI know,Åh he said definitely, ÅgIÅfm one of these trusting fellas and I donÅft 
think any harm to nobody, but when I get to know a thing I know it. It was the 
man in that car. She ran out to speak to him and he wouldnÅft stop.Åh
Michaelis had seen this too, but it hadnÅft occurred to him that there was any 
special significance in it. He believed that Mrs. Wilson had been running away 
from her husband, rather than trying to stop any particular car.
ÅgHow could she of been like that?Åh
ÅgSheÅfs a deep one,Åh said Wilson, as if that answered the question. ÅgAh-h-h&#8212;&#8212;Åh
He began to rock again, and Michaelis stood twisting the leash in his hand.
ÅgMaybe you got some friend that I could telephone for, George?Åh
This was a forlorn hope&#8212;he was almost sure that Wilson had no friend: there was 
not enough of him for his wife. He was glad a little later when he noticed a 
change in the room, a blue quickening by the window, and realized that dawn 
wasnÅft far off. About five oÅfclock it was blue enough outside to snap off the 
light.
WilsonÅfs glazed eyes turned out to the ashheaps, where small gray clouds took on 
fantastic shape and scurried here and there in the faint dawn wind.
ÅgI spoke to her,Åh he muttered, after a long silence. ÅgI told her she might fool 
me but she couldnÅft fool God. I took her to the window.Åh&#8212;with an effort he got 
up and walked to the rear window and leaned with his face pressed against it&#8212;&#8212;Åh 
and I said ÅeGod knows what youÅfve been doing, everything youÅfve been doing. You 
may fool me, but you canÅft fool God!ÅfÅh
Standing behind him, Michaelis saw with a shock that he was looking at the eyes 
of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg, which had just emerged, pale and enormous, from the 
dissolving night.
ÅgGod sees everything,Åh repeated Wilson.
ÅgThatÅfs an advertisement,Åh Michaelis assured him. Something made him turn away 
from the window and look back into the room. But Wilson stood there a long time, 
his face close to the window pane, nodding into the twilight.
By six oÅfclock Michaelis was worn out, and grateful for the sound of a car 
stopping outside. It was one of the watchers of the night before who had 
promised to come back, so he cooked breakfast for three, which he and the other 
man ate together. Wilson was quieter now, and Michaelis went home to sleep; when 
he awoke four hours later and hurried back to the garage, Wilson was gone.
His movements&#8212;he was on foot all the time&#8212;were afterward traced to Port 
Roosevelt and then to GadÅfs Hill, where he bought a sandwich that he didnÅft eat, 
and a cup of coffee. He must have been tired and walking slowly, for he didnÅft 
reach GadÅfs Hill until noon. Thus far there was no difficulty in accounting for 
his time&#8212;there were boys who had seen a man Ågacting sort of crazy,Åh and 
motorists at whom he stared oddly from the side of the road. Then for three 
hours he disappeared from view. The police, on the strength of what he said to 
Michaelis, that he Åghad a way of finding out,Åh supposed that he spent that time 
going from garage to garage thereabout, inquiring for a yellow car. On the other 
hand, no garage man who had seen him ever came forward, and perhaps he had an 
easier, surer way of finding out what he wanted to know. By half-past two he was 
in West Egg, where he asked someone the way to GatsbyÅfs house. So by that time 
he knew GatsbyÅfs name.
At two oÅfclock Gatsby put on his bathing-suit and left word with the butler that 
if any one phoned word was to be brought to him at the pool. He stopped at the 
garage for a pneumatic mattress that had amused his guests during the summer, 
and the chauffeur helped him pump it up. Then he gave instructions that the open 
car wasnÅft to be taken out under any circumstances&#8212;and this was strange, because 
the front right fender needed repair.
Gatsby shouldered the mattress and started for the pool. Once he stopped and 
shifted it a little, and the chauffeur asked him if he needed help, but he shook 
his head and in a moment disappeared among the yellowing trees.
No telephone message arrived, but the butler went without his sleep and waited 
for it until four oÅfclock&#8212;until long after there was any one to give it to if it 
came. I have an idea that Gatsby himself didnÅft believe it would come, and 
perhaps he no longer cared. If that was true he must have felt that he had lost 
the old warm world, paid a high price for living too long with a single dream. 
He must have looked up at an unfamiliar sky through frightening leaves and 
shivered as he found what a grotesque thing a rose is and how raw the sunlight 
was upon the scarcely created grass. A new world, material without being real, 
where poor ghosts, breathing dreams like air, drifted fortuitously about . . . 
like that ashen, fantastic figure gliding toward him through the amorphous 
trees.
The chauffeur&#8212;he was one of WolfshiemÅfs proteges&#8212;heard the shots&#8212;afterward he 
could only say that he hadnÅft thought anything much about them. I drove from the 
station directly to GatsbyÅfs house and my rushing anxiously up the front steps 
was the first thing that alarmed any one. But they knew then, I firmly believe. 
With scarcely a word said, four of us, the chauffeur, butler, gardener, and I, 
hurried down to the pool.
There was a faint, barely perceptible movement of the water as the fresh flow 
from one end urged its way toward the drain at the other. with little ripples 
that were hardly the shadows of waves, the laden mattress moved irregularly down 
the pool. A small gust of wind that scarcely corrugated the surface was enough 
to disturb its accidental course with its accidental burden. The touch of a 
cluster of leaves revolved it slowly, tracing, like the leg of compass, a thin 
red circle in the water.
It was after we started with Gatsby toward the house that the gardener saw 
WilsonÅfs body a little way off in the grass, and the holocaust was complete.
Chapter 9
After two years I remember the rest of that day, and that night and the next 
day, only as an endless drill of police and photographers and newspaper men in 
and out of GatsbyÅfs front door. A rope stretched across the main gate and a 
policeman by it kept out the curious, but little boys soon discovered that they 
could enter through my yard, and there were always a few of them clustered 
open-mouthed about the pool. Someone with a positive manner, perhaps a 
detective, used the expression Ågmadman.Åh as he bent over WilsonÅfs body that 
afternoon, and the adventitious authority of his voice set the key for the 
newspaper reports next morning.
Most of those reports were a nightmare&#8212;grotesque, circumstantial, eager, and 
untrue. When MichaelisÅfs testimony at the inquest brought to light WilsonÅfs 
suspicions of his wife I thought the whole tale would shortly be served up in 
racy pasquinade&#8212;but Catherine, who might have said anything, didnÅft say a word. 
She showed a surprising amount of character about it too&#8212;looked at the coroner 
with determined eyes under that corrected brow of hers, and swore that her 
sister had never seen Gatsby, that her sister was completely happy with her 
husband, that her sister had been into no mischief whatever. She convinced 
herself of it, and cried into her handkerchief, as if the very suggestion was 
more than she could endure. So Wilson was reduced to a man Ågderanged by grief.Åh 
in order that the case might remain in its simplist form. And it rested there.
But all this part of it seemed remote and unessential. I found myself on 
GatsbyÅfs side, and alone. From the moment I telephoned news of the catastrophe 
to West Egg village, every surmise about him, and every practical question, was 
referred to me. At first I was surprised and confused; then, as he lay in his 
house and didnÅft move or breathe or speak, hour upon hour, it grew upon me that 
I was responsible, because no one else was interested&#8212;interested, I mean, with 
that intense personal interest to which every one has some vague right at the 
end.
I called up Daisy half an hour after we found him, called her instinctively and 
without hesitation. But she and Tom had gone away early that afternoon, and 
taken baggage with them.
ÅgLeft no address?Åh
ÅgNo.Åh
ÅgSay when theyÅfd be back?Åh
ÅgNo.Åh
ÅgAny idea where they are? How I could reach them?Åh
ÅgI donÅft know. CanÅft say.Åh
I wanted to get somebody for him. I wanted to go into the room where he lay and 
reassure him: ÅgIÅfll get somebody for you, Gatsby. DonÅft worry. Just trust me and 
IÅfll get somebody for you&#8212;&#8212;Åh
Meyer WolfshiemÅfs name wasnÅft in the phone book. The butler gave me his office 
address on Broadway, and I called Information, but by the time I had the number 
it was long after five, and no one answered the phone.
ÅgWill you ring again?Åh
ÅgIÅfve rung them three times.Åh
ÅgItÅfs very important.Åh
ÅgSorry. IÅfm afraid no oneÅfs there.Åh
I went back to the drawing-room and thought for an instant that they were chance 
visitors, all these official people who suddenly filled it. But, as they drew 
back the sheet and looked at Gatsby with unmoved eyes, his protest continued in 
my brain:
ÅgLook here, old sport, youÅfve got to get somebody for me. YouÅfve got to try 
hard. I canÅft go through this alone.Åh
Some one started to ask me questions, but I broke away and going up-stairs 
looked hastily through the unlocked parts of his desk&#8212;heÅfd never told me 
definitely that his parents were dead. But there was nothing&#8212;only the picture of 
Dan Cody, a token of forgotten violence, staring down from the wall.
Next morning I sent the butler to New York with a letter to Wolfshiem, which 
asked for information and urged him to come out on the next train. That request 
seemed superfluous when I wrote it. I was sure heÅfd start when he saw the 
newspapers, just as I was sure thereÅfd be a wire from Daisy before noon&#8212;but 
neither a wire nor Mr. Wolfshiem arrived; no one arrived except more police and 
photographers and newspaper men. When the butler brought back WolfshiemÅfs answer 
I began to have a feeling of defiance, of scornful solidarity between Gatsby and 
me against them all.
DEAR MR. CARRAWAY. This has been one of the most terrible shocks of my life to 
me I hardly can believe it that it is true at all. Such a mad act as that man 
did should make us all think. I cannot come down now as I am tied up in some 
very important business and cannot get mixed up in this thing now. If there is 
anything I can do a little later let me know in a letter by Edgar. I hardly know 
where I am when I hear about a thing like this and am completely knocked down 
and out.
Yours truly MEYER WOLFSHIEM
and then hasty addenda beneath:
Let me know about the funeral etc. do not know his family at all.
When the phone rang that afternoon and Long Distance said Chicago was calling I 
thought this would be Daisy at last. But the connection came through as a manÅfs 
voice, very thin and far away.
ÅgThis is Slagle speaking . . .Åh
ÅgYes?Åh The name was unfamiliar.
ÅgHell of a note, isnÅft it? Get my wire?Åh
ÅgThere havenÅft been any wires.Åh
ÅgYoung ParkeÅfs in trouble,Åh he said rapidly. ÅgThey picked him up when he handed 
the bonds over the counter. They got a circular from New York giving Åfem the 
numbers just five minutes before. What dÅfyou know about that, hey? You never can 
tell in these hick towns&#8212;&#8212;Åh
ÅgHello!Åh I interrupted breathlessly. ÅgLook here&#8212;this isnÅft Mr. Gatsby. Mr. 
GatsbyÅfs dead.Åh
There was a long silence on the other end of the wire, followed by an 
exclamation . . . then a quick squawk as the connection was broken.
I think it was on the third day that a telegram signed Henry C. Gatz arrived 
from a town in Minnesota. It said only that the sender was leaving immediately 
and to postpone the funeral until he came.
It was GatsbyÅfs father, a solemn old man, very helpless and dismayed, bundled up 
in a long cheap ulster against the warm September day. His eyes leaked 
continuously with excitement, and when I took the bag and umbrella from his 
hands he began to pull so incessantly at his sparse gray beard that I had 
difficulty in getting off his coat. He was on the point of collapse, so I took 
him into the music room and made him sit down while I sent for something to eat. 
But he wouldnÅft eat, and the glass of milk spilled from his trembling hand.
ÅgI saw it in the Chicago newspaper,Åh he said. ÅgIt was all in the Chicago 
newspaper. I started right away.Åh
ÅgI didnÅft know how to reach you.Åh His eyes, seeing nothing, moved ceaselessly 
about the room.
ÅgIt was a madman,Åh he said. ÅgHe must have been mad.Åh
ÅgWouldnÅft you like some coffee?Åh I urged him.
ÅgI donÅft want anything. IÅfm all right now, Mr.&#8212;&#8212;Åh
ÅgCarraway.Åh
ÅgWell, IÅfm all right now. Where have they got Jimmy?Åh I took him into the 
drawing-room, where his son lay, and left him there. Some little boys had come 
up on the steps and were looking into the hall; when I told them who had 
arrived, they went reluctantly away.
After a little while Mr. Gatz opened the door and came out, his mouth ajar, his 
face flushed slightly, his eyes leaking isolated and unpunctual tears. He had 
reached an age where death no longer has the quality of ghastly surprise, and 
when he looked around him now for the first time and saw the height and splendor 
of the hall and the great rooms opening out from it into other rooms, his grief 
began to be mixed with an awed pride. I helped him to a bedroom up-stairs; while 
he took off his coat and vest I told him that all arrangements had been deferred 
until he came.
ÅgI didnÅft know what youÅfd want, Mr. Gatsby&#8212;&#8212;Åh
ÅgGatz is my name.Åh
Åg&#8212;Mr. Gatz. I thought you might want to take the body West.Åh
He shook his head.
ÅgJimmy always liked it better down East. He rose up to his position in the East. 
Were you a friend of my boyÅfs, Mr.&#8212;?Åh
ÅgWe were close friends.Åh
ÅgHe had a big future before him, you know. He was only a young man, but he had a 
lot of brain power here.Åh
He touched his head impressively, and I nodded.
ÅgIf heÅfd of lived, heÅfd of been a great man. A man like James J. Hill. HeÅfd of 
helped build up the country.Åh
ÅgThatÅfs true,Åh I said, uncomfortably.
He fumbled at the embroidered coverlet, trying to take it from the bed, and lay 
down stiffly&#8212;was instantly asleep.
That night an obviously frightened person called up, and demanded to know who I 
was before he would give his name.
ÅgThis is Mr. Carraway,Åh I said.
ÅgOh!Åh He sounded relieved. ÅgThis is Klipspringer.Åh I was relieved too, for that 
seemed to promise another friend at GatsbyÅfs grave. I didnÅft want it to be in 
the papers and draw a sightseeing crowd, so IÅfd been calling up a few people 
myself. They were hard to find.
ÅgThe funeralÅfs to-morrow,Åh I said. ÅgThree oÅfclock, here at the house. I wish 
youÅfd tell anybody whoÅfd be interested.Åh
ÅgOh, I will,Åh he broke out hastily. ÅgOf course IÅfm not likely to see anybody, 
but if I do.Åh
His tone made me suspicious.
ÅgOf course youÅfll be there yourself.Åh
ÅgWell, IÅfll certainly try. What I called up about is&#8212;&#8212;Åh
ÅgWait a minute,Åh I interrupted. ÅgHow about saying youÅfll come?Åh
ÅgWell, the fact is&#8212;the truth of the matter is that IÅfm staying with some people 
up here in Greenwich, and they rather expect me to be with them to-morrow. In 
fact, thereÅfs a sort of picnic or something. Of course IÅfll do my very best to 
get away.Åh
I ejaculated an unrestrained ÅgHuh!Åh and he must have heard me, for he went on 
nervously:
ÅgWhat I called up about was a pair of shoes I left there. Iwonder if itÅfd be too 
much trouble to have the butler send them on. You see, theyÅfre tennis shoes, and 
IÅfm sort of helpless without them. My address is care of B. F.&#8212;&#8212;Åh
I didnÅft hear the rest of the name, because I hung up the receiver.
After that I felt a certain shame for Gatsby&#8212;one gentleman to whom I telephoned 
implied that he had got what he deserved. However, that was my fault, for he was 
one of those who used to sneer most bitterly at Gatsby on the courage of 
GatsbyÅfs liquor, and I should have known better than to call him.
The morning of the funeral I went up to New York to see Meyer Wolfshiem; I 
couldnÅft seem to reach him any other way. The door that I pushed open, on the 
advice of an elevator boy, was marked ÅgThe Swastika Holding Company,Åh and at 
first there didnÅft seem to be any one inside. But when IÅfd shouted Åghello.Åh 
several times in vain, an argument broke out behind a partition, and presently a 
lovely Jewess appeared at an interior door and scrutinized me with black hostile 
eyes.
ÅgNobodyÅfs in,Åh she said. ÅgMr. WolfshiemÅfs gone to Chicago.Åh
The first part of this was obviously untrue, for someone had begun to whistle 
ÅgThe Rosary,Åh tunelessly, inside.
ÅgPlease say that Mr. Carraway wants to see him.Åh
ÅgI canÅft get him back from Chicago, can I?Åh
At this moment a voice, unmistakably WolfshiemÅfs, called ÅgStella!Åh from the 
other side of the door.
ÅgLeave your name on the desk,Åh she said quickly. ÅgIÅfll give it to him when he 
gets back.Åh
ÅgBut I know heÅfs there.Åh
She took a step toward me and began to slide her hands indignantly up and down 
her hips.
ÅgYou young men think you can force your way in here any time,Åh she scolded. 
ÅgWeÅfre getting sickantired of it. When I say heÅfs in Chicago, heÅfs in Chicago.Åh
I mentioned Gatsby.
ÅgOh&#8212;h!Åh She looked at me over again. ÅgWill you just&#8212;What was your name?Åh
She vanished. In a moment Meyer Wolfshiem stood solemnly in the doorway, holding 
out both hands. He drew me into his office, remarking in a reverent voice that 
it was a sad time for all of us, and offered me a cigar.
ÅgMy memory goes back to when I first met him,Åh he said. ÅgA young major just out 
of the army and covered over with medals he got in the war. He was so hard up he 
had to keep on wearing his uniform because he couldnÅft buy some regular clothes. 
First time I saw him was when he come into WinebrennerÅfs poolroom at Forty-third 
Street and asked for a job. He hadnÅft eat anything for a couple of days. Åecome 
on have some lunch with me,Åf I sid. He ate more than four dollarsÅf worth of food 
in half an hour.Åh
ÅgDid you start him in business?Åh I inquired.
ÅgStart him! I made him.Åh
ÅgOh.Åh
ÅgI raised him up out of nothing, right out of the gutter. I saw right away he 
was a fine-appearing, gentlemanly young man, and when he told me he was an 
Oggsford I knew I could use him good. I got him to join up in the American 
Legion and he used to stand high there. Right off he did some work for a client 
of mine up to Albany. We were so thick like that in everything.Åh&#8212;he held up two 
bulbous fingers&#8212;&#8212;Åh always together.Åh
I wondered if this partnership had included the WorldÅfs Series transaction in 
1919.
ÅgNow heÅfs dead,Åh I said after a moment. ÅgYou were his closest friend, so I know 
youÅfll want to come to his funeral this afternoon.Åh
ÅgIÅfd like to come.Åh
ÅgWell, come then.Åh
The hair in his nostrils quivered slightly, and as he shook his head his eyes 
filled with tears.
ÅgI canÅft do it&#8212;I canÅft get mixed up in it,Åh he said.
ÅgThereÅfs nothing to get mixed up in. ItÅfs all over now.Åh
ÅgWhen a man gets killed I never like to get mixed up in it in any way. I keep 
out. When I was a young man it was different&#8212;if a friend of mine died, no matter 
how, I stuck with them to the end. You may think thatÅfs sentimental, but I mean 
it&#8212;to the bitter end.Åh
I saw that for some reason of his own he was determined not to come, so I stood 
up.
ÅgAre you a college man?Åh he inquired suddenly.
For a moment I thought he was going to suggest a Åggonnegtion,Åh but he only 
nodded and shook my hand.
ÅgLet us learn to show our friendship for a man when he is alive and not after he 
is dead,Åh he suggested. ÅgAfter that my own rule is to let everything alone.Åh
When I left his office the sky had turned dark and I got back to West Egg in a 
drizzle. After changing my clothes I went next door and found Mr. Gatz walking 
up and down excitedly in the hall. His pride in his son and in his sonÅfs 
possessions was continually increasing and now he had something to show me.
ÅgJimmy sent me this picture.Åh He took out his wallet with trembling fingers. 
ÅgLook there.Åh
It was a photograph of the house, cracked in the corners and dirty with many 
hands. He pointed out every detail to me eagerly. ÅgLook there!Åh and then sought 
admiration from my eyes. He had shown it so often that I think it was more real 
to him now than the house itself.
ÅgJimmy sent it to me. I think itÅfs a very pretty picture. It shows up well.Åh
ÅgVery well. Had you seen him lately?Åh
ÅgHe come out to see me two years ago and bought me the house I live in now. Of 
course we was broke up when he run off from home, but I see now there was a 
reason for it. He knew he had a big future in front of him. And ever since he 
made a success he was very generous with me.Åh He seemed reluctant to put away 
the picture, held it for another minute, lingeringly, before my eyes. Then he 
returned the wallet and pulled from his pocket a ragged old copy of a book 
called HOPALONG CASSIDY.
ÅgLook here, this is a book he had when he was a boy. It just shows you.Åh
He opened it at the back cover and turned it around for me to see. On the last 
fly-leaf was printed the word SCHEDULE, and the date September 12, 1906. and 
underneath:
Rise from bed . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 6.00 A.M. Dumbbell exercise and 
wall-scaling . . . . . . 6.15-6.30 Åh Study electricity, etc . . . . . . . . . .

smokeing or chewing Bath every other day Read one improving book or magazine per 
week Save $5.00 {crossed out} $3.00 per week Be better to parents
ÅgI come across this book by accident,Åh said the old man. ÅgIt just shows you, 
donÅft it?Åh
ÅgIt just shows you.Åh
ÅgJimmy was bound to get ahead. He always had some resolves like this or 
something. Do you notice what heÅfs got about improving his mind? He was always 
great for that. He told me I et like a hog once, and I beat him for it.Åh
He was reluctant to close the book, reading each item aloud and then looking 
eagerly at me. I think he rather expected me to copy down the list for my own 
use.
A little before three the Lutheran minister arrived from Flushing, and I began 
to look involuntarily out the windows for other cars. So did GatsbyÅfs father. 
And as the time passed and the servants came in and stood waiting in the hall, 
his eyes began to blink anxiously, and he spoke of the rain in a worried, 
uncertain way. The minister glanced several times at his watch, so I took him 
aside and asked him to wait for half an hour. But it wasnÅft any use. Nobody 
came.
About five oÅfclock our procession of three cars reached the cemetery and stopped 
in a thick drizzle beside the gate&#8212;first a motor hearse, horribly black and wet, 
then Mr. Gatz and the minister and I in the limousine, and a little later four 
or five servants and the postman from West Egg in GatsbyÅfs station wagon, all 
wet to the skin. As we started through the gate into the cemetery I heard a car 
stop and then the sound of someone splashing after us over the soggy ground. I 
looked around. It was the man with owl-eyed glasses whom I had found marvelling 
over GatsbyÅfs books in the library one night three months before.
IÅfd never seen him since then. I donÅft know how he knew about the funeral, or 
even his name. The rain poured down his thick glasses, and he took them off and 
wiped them to see the protecting canvas unrolled from GatsbyÅfs grave.
I tried to think about Gatsby then for a moment, but he was already too far 
away, and I could only remember, without resentment, that Daisy hadnÅft sent a 
message or a flower. Dimly I heard someone murmur, ÅgBlessed are the dead that 
the rain falls on,Åh and then the owl-eyed man said ÅgAmen to that,Åh in a brave 
voice.
We straggled down quickly through the rain to the cars. Owl-eyes spoke to me by 
the gate.
ÅgI couldnÅft get to the house,Åh he remarked.
ÅgNeither could anybody else.Åh
ÅgGo on!Åh He started. ÅgWhy, my God! they used to go there by the hundreds.Åh He 
took off his glasses and wiped them again, outside and in.
ÅgThe poor son-of-a-bitch,Åh he said.
One of my most vivid memories is of coming back West from prep school and later 
from college at Christmas time. Those who went farther than Chicago would gather 
in the old dim Union Station at six oÅfclock of a December evening, with a few 
Chicago friends, already caught up into their own holiday gayeties, to bid them 
a hasty good-by. I remember the fur coats of the girls returning from Miss 
This-or-thatÅfs and the chatter of frozen breath and the hands waving overhead as 
we caught sight of old acquaintances, and the matchings of invitations: ÅgAre you 
going to the OrdwaysÅf? the HerseysÅf? the SchultzesÅf?Åh and the long green tickets 
clasped tight in our gloved hands. And last the murky yellow cars of the 
Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul railroad looking cheerful as Christmas itself on 
the tracks beside the gate.
When we pulled out into the winter night and the real snow, our snow, began to 
stretch out beside us and twinkle against the windows, and the dim lights of 
small Wisconsin stations moved by, a sharp wild brace came suddenly into the 
air. We drew in deep breaths of it as we walked back from dinner through the 
cold vestibules, unutterably aware of our identity with this country for one 
strange hour, before we melted indistinguishably into it again.
ThatÅfs my Middle West&#8212;not the wheat or the prairies or the lost Swede towns, but 
the thrilling returning trains of my youth, and the street lamps and sleigh 
bells in the frosty dark and the shadows of holly wreaths thrown by lighted 
windows on the snow. I am part of that, a little solemn with the feel of those 
long winters, a little complacent from growing up in the Carraway house in a 
city where dwellings are still called through decades by a familyÅfs name. I see 
now that this has been a story of the West, after all&#8212;Tom and Gatsby, Daisy and 
Jordan and I, were all Westerners, and perhaps we possessed some deficiency in 
common which made us subtly unadaptable to Eastern life.
Even when the East excited me most, even when I was most keenly aware of its 
superiority to the bored, sprawling, swollen towns beyond the Ohio, with their 
interminable inquisitions which spared only the children and the very old&#8212;even 
then it had always for me a quality of distortion. West Egg, especially, still 
figures in my more fantastic dreams. I see it as a night scene by El Greco: a 
hundred houses, at once conventional and grotesque, crouching under a sullen, 
overhanging sky and a lustreless moon. In the foreground four solemn men in 
dress suits are walking along the sidewalk with a stretcher on which lies a 
drunken woman in a white evening dress. Her hand, which dangles over the side, 
sparkles cold with jewels. Gravely the men turn in at a house&#8212;the wrong house. 
But no one knows the womanÅfs name, and no one cares.
After GatsbyÅfs death the East was haunted for me like that, distorted beyond my 
eyesÅf power of correction. So when the blue smoke of brittle leaves was in the 
air and the wind blew the wet laundry stiff on the line I decided to come back 
home.
There was one thing to be done before I left, an awkward, unpleasant thing that 
perhaps had better have been let alone. But I wanted to leave things in order 
and not just trust that obliging and indifferent sea to sweep my refuse away. I 
saw Jordan Baker and talked over and around what had happened to us together, 
and what had happened afterward to me, and she lay perfectly still, listening, 
in a big chair.
She was dressed to play golf, and I remember thinking she looked like a good 
illustration, her chin raised a little jauntily, her hair the color of an autumn 
leaf, her face the same brown tint as the fingerless glove on her knee. When I 
had finished she told me without comment that she was engaged to another man. I 
doubted that, though there were several she could have married at a nod of her 
head, but I pretended to be surprised. For just a minute I wondered if I wasnÅft 
making a mistake, then I thought it all over again quickly and got up to say 
good-bye.
ÅgNevertheless you did throw me over,Åh said Jordan suddenly. ÅgYou threw me over 
on the telephone. I donÅft give a damn about you now, but it was a new experience 
for me, and I felt a little dizzy for a while.Åh
We shook hands.
ÅgOh, and do you remember.Åh&#8212;she added&#8212;&#8212;Åh a conversation we had once about driving 
a car?Åh
ÅgWhy&#8212;not exactly.Åh
ÅgYou said a bad driver was only safe until she met another bad driver? Well, I 
met another bad driver, didnÅft I? I mean it was careless of me to make such a 
wrong guess. I thought you were rather an honest, straightforward person. I 
thought it was your secret pride.Åh
ÅgIÅfm thirty,Åh I said. ÅgIÅfm five years too old to lie to myself and call it 
honor.Åh
She didnÅft answer. Angry, and half in love with her, and tremendously sorry, I 
turned away.
One afternoon late in October I saw Tom Buchanan. He was walking ahead of me 
along Fifth Avenue in his alert, aggressive way, his hands out a little from his 
body as if to fight off interference, his head moving sharply here and there, 
adapting itself to his restless eyes. Just as I slowed up to avoid overtaking 
him he stopped and began frowning into the windows of a jewelry store. Suddenly 
he saw me and walked back, holding out his hand.
ÅgWhatÅfs the matter, Nick? Do you object to shaking hands with me?Åh
ÅgYes. You know what I think of you.Åh
ÅgYouÅfre crazy, Nick,Åh he said quickly. ÅgCrazy as hell. I donÅft know whatÅfs the 
matter with you.Åh
ÅgTom,Åh I inquired, Ågwhat did you say to Wilson that afternoon?Åh He stared at me 
without a word, and I knew I had guessed right about those missing hours. I 
started to turn away, but he took a step after me and grabbed my arm.
ÅgI told him the truth,Åh he said. ÅgHe came to the door while we were getting 
ready to leave, and when I sent down word that we werenÅft in he tried to force 
his way up-stairs. He was crazy enough to kill me if I hadnÅft told him who owned 
the car. His hand was on a revolver in his pocket every minute he was in the 
house&#8212;&#8212;Åh He broke off defiantly. ÅgWhat if I did tell him? That fellow had it 
coming to him. He threw dust into your eyes just like he did in DaisyÅfs, but he 
was a tough one. He ran over Myrtle like youÅfd run over a dog and never even 
stopped his car.Åh
There was nothing I could say, except the one unutterable fact that it wasnÅft 
true.
ÅgAnd if you think I didnÅft have my share of suffering&#8212;look here, when I went to 
give up that flat and saw that damn box of dog biscuits sitting there on the 
sideboard, I sat down and cried like a baby. By God it was awful&#8212;&#8212;Åh
I couldnÅft forgive him or like him, but I saw that what he had done was, to him, 
entirely justified. It was all very careless and confused. They were careless 
people, Tom and Daisy&#8212;they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated 
back into their money or their vast carelessness, or whatever it was that kept 
them together, and let other people clean up the mess they had made. . . .
I shook hands with him; it seemed silly not to, for I felt suddenly as though I 
were talking to a child. Then he went into the jewelry store to buy a pearl 
necklace&#8212;or perhaps only a pair of cuff buttons&#8212;rid of my provincial 
squeamishness forever.
GatsbyÅfs house was still empty when I left&#8212;the grass on his lawn had grown as 
long as mine. One of the taxi drivers in the village never took a fare past the 
entrance gate without stopping for a minute and pointing inside; perhaps it was 
he who drove Daisy and Gatsby over to East Egg the night of the accident, and 
perhaps he had made a story about it all his own. I didnÅft want to hear it and I 
avoided him when I got off the train.
I spent my Saturday nights in New York because those gleaming, dazzling parties 
of his were with me so vividly that I could still hear the music and the 
laughter, faint and incessant, from his garden, and the cars going up and down 
his drive. One night I did hear a material car there, and saw its lights stop at 
his front steps. But I didnÅft investigate. Probably it was some final guest who 
had been away at the ends of the earth and didnÅft know that the party was over.
On the last night, with my trunk packed and my car sold to the grocer, I went 
over and looked at that huge incoherent failure of a house once more. On the 
white steps an obscene word, scrawled by some boy with a piece of brick, stood 
out clearly in the moonlight, and I erased it, drawing my shoe raspingly along 
the stone. Then I wandered down to the beach and sprawled out on the sand.
Most of the big shore places were closed now and there were hardly any lights 
except the shadowy, moving glow of a ferryboat across the Sound. And as the moon 
rose higher the inessential houses began to melt away until gradually I became 
aware of the old island here that flowered once for Dutch sailorsÅf eyes&#8212;a fresh, 
green breast of the new world. Its vanished trees, the trees that had made way 
for GatsbyÅfs house, had once pandered in whispers to the last and greatest of 
all human dreams; for a transitory enchanted moment man must have held his 
breath in the presence of this continent, compelled into an aesthetic 
contemplation he neither understood nor desired, face to face for the last time 
in history with something commensurate to his capacity for wonder.
And as I sat there brooding on the old, unknown world, I thought of GatsbyÅfs 
wonder when he first picked out the green light at the end of DaisyÅfs dock. He 
had come a long way to this blue lawn, and his dream must have seemed so close 
that he could hardly fail to grasp it. He did not know that it was already 
behind him, somewhere back in that vast obscurity beyond the city, where the 
dark fields of the republic rolled on under the night.
Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year 
recedes before us. It eluded us then, but thatÅfs no matter&#8212;to-morrow we will run 
faster, stretch out our arms farther. . . . And one fine morning&#8212;&#8212;
So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.
