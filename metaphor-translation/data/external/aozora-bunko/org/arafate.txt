      Brother Speaker of the PLC,
      Sisters and brothers, members of the PLC,
      Ladies and Gentlemen,
      Dear guests,
      Excellencies, ambassadors and consul generals,
                At the start of our session today, allow me to convey my 
      greetings, esteem and love to all our heroic prisoners and detainees in 
      the Israeli prisons and detection centers, whether they be Palestinian or 
      Arab cadres, militants or leaders. I would like to say to the noble 
      knights of our brave people, in whose patience and steadfastness we are 
      proud, and who are currently waging a struggle and a battle inside these 
      distressful prisons, indeed distressful. The prisons of Abu Gareib are an 
      example for that, as if they have moved from there to here. I would like 
      to say to these prisoners going on a hunger-strike: your people and your 
      Arab nation are with you. All honorable and freedom-loving people around 
      the world are with you. Your liberation stands at the top of our 
      priorities and duties. The Palestinian leadership and all the national 
      factions and forces have decided to participate today with you in the 
      hunger strike and in the mass-popular actions taking place at home and in 
      the diaspora. The leadership has also decided to act on the Arab and 
      international levels to confront and deal with the sufferings you are 
      subjected to in your jails and prisons in order to set you free, God be 
      willing. The action on the Arab and international levels has already 
      started on your behalf. We have formed a leadership sub-committee for this 
      purpose. With GodÅfs help, we will be together side by side, in Holy 
      Jerusalem, Al-Quds Ash-Sharif. Here, I would like to ask for your 
      collective agreement to deduct one dayÅfs work from all working-people to 
      our beloved ones in their prisons and detention camps.
                I would like to say, here, one important thing. The Israeli 
      minister of internal security, Hanegbi, stated "let these prisoners die." 
      I tell him "we are all possible martyrs and not afraid of death." His 
      statement "let them strike until they die" is a statement that goes 
      against all human and international laws and against the laws of 
      civilization. It is also my right to point out here that the Israeli 
      authorities have announced that they started to distribute pills to help 
      respiration in the Demona area where the Israeli nuclear facilities are 
      purported to be. Why distribute it to the Israelis only!!! In that area 
      the Israelis maintain three prisons for our Palestinian heroes the 
      prisoners. Why do not the Israelis distribute these pills for the 
      Palestinian prisoners as well? Aren't they considered human beings? This 
      is really against the rules and laws of humanity. We will overcome.
        
      Sisters and brothers,
        
      Our meeting today has many significant symbols and meanings.
      Our meeting today is a clear sign to all that affirms our determination as 
      a people, leadership and institutions, to continue our work, and to rise 
      up, despite the on-going siege and aggressions.
        
                Our meeting today is also a manifestation of the vitality of our 
      institutions which are being exposed, for years, to unceasing aggressive 
      campaigns, in an attempt to weaken and undermine them in order to 
      liquidate our (Palestinian) Authority and national entity. However, their 
      attempts will be in vain.
        
                I am addressing you, today at this meeting, after four years 
      have passed since the outbreak of the Al Aqsa uprising. [After he was 
      permitted to go to the holy Al Haram Ash-Sharif in violation of all rules 
      and decisions provided they respect such rules. Moshe Dayan, their hero, 
      went following the occupation of Holy Jerusalem, in 1967, (to the holy Al 
      Aqsa Mosque) and took down the Israeli flag which was raised by the 
      extremists. He issued an order on 16 June forbidding Jews to visit this 
      holy site. I said this to Barak, (the former Israeli prime minister). I 
      was accompanied by Abu Ala'a, Abu Mazen, Saeb Ereikat, and Nabil Abu 
      Rudeina. I went to Barak's house and asked him not to commit that mistake. 
      But he did. The massacres took place. Nineteen martyrs and eighty injured 
      persons fell on Thursday and Friday. Yet we will overcome.] I am 
      addressing you, today, also after ten years have passed since the 
      establishment of our National Authority. It is an occasion that requires 
      us to stop and look into this march of ten years. It is a stop to evaluate 
      and to rectify. It is a stop to see where we were right and where we went 
      wrong and what is the way to correct the wrong. [No one is without 
      mistakes. Let those who claim to be without a mistake throw at us a stone. 
      I only want to remind you of that saying]. It is an objective stand with 
      the self, where we do not indulge in self-torture that eclipses what we 
      have achieved, and where we do not try to ignore or cover up the 
      shortcomings, the failings and incapabilities wherever they may be. [No 
      one is without mistakes] It is a stand which allows us to look into all 
      subjective and objective circumstances that have formed and accompanied 
      our march and put it back on its historic track taking into consideration 
      all its national, regional and international ramifications. It is a stand 
      that requires us to confirm our braveness by recognizing our mistakes, if 
      be, and our firm determination by correcting these mistakes and setting 
      them right.
        
                This stand requires us to draw lessons so that we would be able 
      to apply them in the best Palestinian national interest. The vitality of 
      our great Palestinian people and the tradition of our long national march, 
      [including a long list of victories that we have achieved], are a great 
      source of experience and determination for us to continue the march in a 
      strong, resolute, determined and faithful manner in every stage and in 
      front of every challenge.
        
                Ours is a besieged people. Its leadership is besieged. But we 
      hold firmly to our national rights and aims. It is a wounded people, full 
      of confidence, hope and belief in their cause.
        
                It is a people that are subjected to this ongoing racist and 
      brutal aggression. But, it is a people that continues to carve the miracle 
      of survival, steadfastness, heroism and creatively because ÅgIn this land 
      are a people of exceeding strength,Åh and Ågthey are steadfast until the Day 
      of Judgment.Åh 
        
      Sisters and brothers,
        
                Since the first day of the establishment of the PNA, we have 
      affirmed and propagated during the presidentional and legislative election 
      campaign that, ahead of us, lays the achievement of a national working 
      programme that has two national tasks. The first historic task was to put 
      an end to the oppressive occupation of our land and Christian and Islamic 
      holy places, and the establishment of the independent State of Palestine, 
      with Holy Jerusalem as its capital. The second was the establishment of 
      the PNA as a basis and foundation stone for building our esteemed 
      independent state.
               
                As to the first task, we had all the time affirmed the following 
      important and basic points:-
      1-                The aims of the Palestinian people, as defined by the 
      institutions of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), are 
      determined by putting an end to the Israeli occupation; the establishment 
      of the independent state of Palestine, with Holy Jerusalem as its capital, 
      on all the territories occupied in 1967; [we have made these decisions in 
      1988, at the PNC session held in Algiers, and in 1973 at the PNC session 
      held in Cairo];the protection of our Christian and Islamic holy places on 
      this sacred and blessed land, especially confronting the threats directed 
      against the Holy Al Aqsa Mosque by the Zionist extremists; and by solving 
      the issue of the Palestinian refugees in accordance with the UN 
      resolutions. [At Camp David we have agreed to start with my brothers and 
      sisters, the refugees in Lebanon. The issue of the displaced persons, as 
      you know, is being dealt with by an Egyptian, Jordanian, Israeli and 
      Palestinian quadruple committee. A large number of them came back.
      2-                The road to peace represents to our people a strategic 
      choice, since we have adopted the political programme of the PLO at the 
      Palestine National Council session in Algiers in 1988. [We started in 
      Madrid and continued on the Arab and international levels]. We are 
      committed to the choice of negotiations to solve the conflict, as was 
      determined by the peace agreements that started in Madrid, Washington and 
      Oslo, which we have signed with the Government of Israel in 1993 at the 
      White House, under the auspices of President Clinton, and with our late 
      partner, Yitzhak Rabin, and which we have followed up in Cairo and, here, 
      at home. 
      3-                At the time in which we have made courageously the 
      choice of historic reconciliation in the interest of peace we have 
      affirmed that we are struggling to establish the independent state of 
      Palestine, side by side with Israel, and we have warned, from day one, 
      against the consequences of any Israeli practices, especially in the field 
      of settlement, to undermine the possibility of establishing our state. I 
      would like to remind you of one of the agreements I made with my late 
      partner Yitzhak Rabin in which he said no new settlements, no new house to 
      be added to any settlement, the fence of any settlement will be 50 meters 
      far from the last house. These settlements were supposed to be removed 
      around 1998. Yet yesterday they announced that they are building 1115 new 
      housing units. 
        
      We have entered, over the last years, the marathon of unending 
      negotiations, with the Israeli side, especially with its peace force. We 
      had to bear the ramifications of changes in the (Israeli) governments and 
      ideologies. But, while we have clung, over the years, strongly to our 
      rights, we were careful to support the choice of negotiations, and the 
      peace of the brave. We raised the motto of demanding the implementation of 
      the signed agreements and dues due on each party. This we have done even 
      in the darkest and most difficult circumstances, we have underlined, 
      constantly, the role of the international community and the sponsors of 
      the peace process. We have always affirmed that peace is not only in the 
      Palestinian and Israeli interests but also it is in the interest of the 
      whole region and of all countries the world over.
        
      During all these years we have knocked at all doors. We have sought every 
      possible glimpse of hope. We have studied and considered every possible 
      proposal or initiative or project or plan. We have dealt with them with 
      open mind taking as our guide the highest national interest of our people 
      and the pan-Arab interest of our nation.
        
      Testimonies have been made, over the last years, by international, US and 
      Israeli previous and incumbent officials that testify that we did not 
      squander any real opportunity that came in sight to us to make peace and 
      to realize the hopes of our people in establishing just permanent and 
      comprehensive peace in the whole region.
        
      Yet, on the other side, the basic slogan of the Government of Israel, 
      especially the incumbent one was: there are no sacred dates and priority 
      goes to Israeli security. The assassination, at the hands of extremist 
      Jewish elements, of our partner, Yitzhak Rabin, was the beginning of a 
      fundamental upheaval, a coup dÅfetate, at the Israeli political theater. 
      The Government of Israel started to disavow the essence of the peace 
      process and the partnership between us to make peace, the peace of the 
      brave, the peace whose aim was to establish the state of Palestine, side 
      by side, with Israel in order to make a new future for us, for them and 
      for all the peoples of the region and the world over.
        
      The most explicit embodiment of the attempts to destroy the peace process 
      is the ongoing campaign of settlement of our land. This reached its apex 
      with the project of building the wall of racial discrimination, called 
      also the Berlin Wall, which confiscates 58% of our lands, including Holy 
      Jerusalem, and annexes them to Israel. This aims at fragmenting the 
      Palestinian geographic and demographic unity, turning our people into 
      refugees, and putting the remaining Palestinians under siege and in 
      cantons and prisons surrounded by settlements and walls that destroy any 
      opportunity to establish the state of Palestine.
        
      As our people rose up against the campaign of colonial settlement, the 
      confiscation of land and against the aggression on the Holy Al Aqsa Mosque 
      and against the current grave threats that it is exposed to, [as has been 
      declared by the Israeli minister of internal security and not by me],  
      Israel continued its plan of total war against our Palestinian people, 
      their Authority, land and Christian and Islamic holy places. The 
      reoccupation of the West Bank and parts of the Gaza Strip was the climax 
      of this war, aimed at the destruction of our PNA, in the hope of 
      liquidating the national aims and rights of our people. Israel rejected 
      all Arab and international solutions and efforts at Camp David, Sharm 
      Esh-Sheikh, Paris, Taba, the George Tenet-Understandings, the Mitchell 
      Report, the efforts of the Quartet and the Road Map, which we accepted and 
      which the Arab countries accepted at the Arab summit meetings, and on 
      which Israel put more reservations than the text of the Road Map itself.
      Israel continued its shelling, incursions, penetrations, assassinations 
      and detentions; it continued to tighten the siege and check-points and 
      continued to destroy the infra-structures that we have built. Israel 
      targeted our fields, farms and our factories by waging a black campaign to 
      destroy the achievements of our Palestinian people and to drive them into 
      poverty and hunger. Israel continued to destroy our towns, cities, 
      refugee-camps and villages, like Jenin, Nablus and its old city; Beit 
      Hanoun, Rafah, Qalquilia and Tulkarem; and like Hebron especially what 
      happened at the Holy Al Ibrahimi Mosque and the destruction of the 
      historic and ancient houses of the cityÅfs ÅgChristian Valley,Åh in order to 
      make the settlement of Kreat Arba' part of the Ibrahimi Mosque, and as 
      also happened at our refugee camps in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip and 
      other towns and villages. By so doing, Israel hopes to undermine our 
      eternal bond with our sacred land.
      It, furthermore, targeted, in a black campaign, our Christian and Islamic 
      holy places. It was bent on causing harm to our old cities, with all the 
      meaning these carry in terms of their genuine history, features of 
      civilization, and human creativity, as we can see that in Nablus, Hebron 
      and Bethlehem. It closed the religious road that connects the Church of 
      the Nativity (in Bethlehem) and the Church of the Holy Sepulcher in 
      Jerusalem with this wall of racism. It used internationally prohibited 
      weapons, like depleted uranium as was testified by an American and a Dutch 
      report, thus increasing the level of cancerous deceases and the 
      infertility rates, and like using the internationally prohibited dumdum 
      with which they shot Nabil Amre. All this happens daily, indeed every 
      minute. Our people pay the price in thousands of martyrs and injured 
      people who fall on the streets, inside their safe homes and at Israeli 
      check-points. This is a reality that the whole world follows and sees on 
      TV screens and through the delegations of the peace forces the world over, 
      and the other official delegations.
        
      The Israeli aggressive campaign concentrated on destroying the centers and 
      headquarters of our security forces and apparatus, as well as our 
      ministries and institutions and on tightening the strangulating siege to 
      stop work at all our executive, legislative and judicial institutions.
        
      The aim of the Israeli occupation was, and still is, to undermine, indeed, 
      destroy, the PNA and to create a state of vacuum in order to claim Ågthere 
      is no Palestinian partner,Åh and to attempt to make the Zionist schemes 
      pass which aim at undermining our peopleÅfs firm rights in their sacred 
      land. They claim there is no Palestinian partner. But who signed the Wye 
      River agreement with us? It is Netenyahu and Sharon themselves. Who signed 
      the Paris, Washington and Oslo agreements? Cannot they see a partner? Or 
      do they only see phantoms?
        
      All this was accompanied by an outrageous campaign to defame our national 
      struggle, to harm its guiding principles and humanist aims, in an attempt 
      to link it to terrorism.
      We were the first to condemn the barbaric attacks that were carried out in 
      New York and Washington in 2001. We have clearly warned any party, against 
      any attempt to take the Palestinian cause as a pretext, or to hide behind 
      the generous Islamic religion in carrying out these deeds which we 
      strongly reject and vehemently condemn. This we do, on the basis of our 
      heritage, principles and values, because we are the victims of the Israeli 
      state terror and the terror of the Zionist extremists their in. we have 
      continuously affirmed the organic bond between our peopleÅfs struggle and 
      their aspiration to freedom and peace.
        
      Surly, the ruling of the International Court of Justice, at the Hague, on 
      the issue of the wall of racial discrimination, as well as the sweeping 
      vote at the UN General Assembly in support of the ruling of the ICJ have 
      confirmed, in an unswerving manner, that the world was not deceived by the 
      Israeli campaign. The highest international judicial court, and the 
      highest international forum have unmasked the true picture which the 
      Israeli governments attempted to cover, namely that there is an 
      expansionist Israeli occupation which has to be ended, so that the 
      Palestinian people recover their legitimates rights, their freedom and 
      establish their independent state, like all other peoples the world over. 
      We are now the only people under occupation in the world.
        
      Sisters and brothers,
        
                Despite all that happened, and is still happening, despite the 
      ongoing aggression, despite the siege that our people, and we, are living 
      through and feel in this MuqataÅfah, which has been destroyed more than 
      once, despite all that, I would like to assure you once again, that our 
      adherence to our rights will be unswerving, that our belief in the choice 
      of peace with Israel exists and is still strong as well as with the 
      Israeli peace forces.
        
                In this regard, and in front of you, dear sisters and brothers, 
      members of the PLC, and before the whole world, I would like to reiterate, 
      once again, that the Palestinian people, who are waging a struggle to get 
      rid of the last remnants of occupation the world over, are determined to 
      march on the road of peace in order to get their freedom, to end 
      occupation and to build the independent state of Palestine, with Holy 
      Jerusalem as its capital.                        
        
                On behalf of the Palestinian leadership and people, I would like 
      to confirm, once more, our holding tight to the choice of peace. I would 
      like to confirm our call for the implementation of the signed agreements, 
      the last of which was the Road Map, I would like to confirm as well our 
      holding to the vision of US Preside George W. Bush and to the Arab peace 
      initiative which was adopted at the Beirut Summit and reaffirmed at the 
      Tunis Summit on realizing a negotiated settlement to the conflict that 
      implements the decisions and resolutions of international legality.
        
                I would like to confirm here, once again, the firm Palestinian 
      position of condemning and rejecting all operations that target civilians, 
      Palestinians and Israelis. It is a rejection that stems from our 
      convictions, values, principles, heritage and the highest interests of our 
      people. We have repeatedly warned that these operations present Israel 
      with a pretext to escalate its aggression against our people and provide 
      it with weapons to be used politically and on the information level in its 
      attempt to defame our national struggle and our aim of establishing our 
      independent state.
        
                In confronting the construction of the wall of racial 
      discrimination, our people have made a model for the courageous peopleÅfs 
      resistance which gained the support and sympathy of the world. It is a 
      model that has to be consolidated in order to melt all the energies of our 
      people in the melting pot of national struggle.      
        
                From here, I send an appeal to the government of Israel and say: 
      It is enough. Let us give peace a chance. Let us return, forthwith, to the 
      negotiating table, to implement the agreements and arrive at a final 
      settlement. I say to our Israeli neighbors: the Palestinian people, who 
      hold firmly to their right, hold firmly, as well, to peace. Let us 
      immediately stop the flow of blood and destruction. Let us work together 
      for a peace that provides security, stability and prosperity for our 
      future generations and for the whole region.
        
                From here, I appeal, as well, to the parties of the Quartet, to 
      act in order to stop the Israeli aggression and occupation against our 
      people and to begin the implementation of the Road Map in order to make 
      available the appropriate climate for the immediate resumption of the 
      peace negotiations in the region.      
        
                I would like here to point out the reports on the plans of the 
      Israeli government to withdraw from the Gaza Strip. We see that Israel is 
      practicing on the ground a comprehensive campaign of destruction that is 
      in contradiction to its purported intents. Yet, we would like to confirm 
      the readiness of the PNA to extend Palestinian national sovereignty, and 
      to bear full responsibilities on any piece of land from which the Israeli 
      occupation withdraws.
        
                We believe that any withdrawal from the Gaza Strip has to be 
      parallel to other withdrawals in the West Bank in a way that maintains the 
      geographic contiguity and the demographic and political unity of the two 
      wings of our homeland. This withdrawal should also be total and 
      comprehensive in the Gaza Strip and be a part of the implementation of the 
      Road Map, so as to realize the withdrawal from all the Palestinian 
      Territory occupied in 1967 and to establish the state of Palestine to the 
      side of Israel.
        
                In this regard, I would like to express our appreciation of the 
      position and efforts made by the blessed President, Husni Mubarak, and our 
      other brothers in the Arab Republic of Egypt, who did not stop making for 
      one moment, true efforts in support of our people and the revival of the 
      peace process. We have responded positively to all their opinions and 
      efforts. I would like here, as well, to make note of the positions of the 
      Arab counties, especially our brothers in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, who 
      persevered in their support of our cause and in providing our people with 
      financial support, our people who are living through very difficult times. 
      I would like, as well, to appreciate the positions of the brothers in 
      Tunisia, Jordan, Syria and the other Arab brothers from Yemen and the 
      Sudan in the south to Oman and the Iraq to the east. I would like, also, 
      to take note of the positions of Latin America, Japan, China, the Islamic, 
      African and Nor-Aligned Movement summits. We also appreciate the positions 
      of Europe, Russia and the UN, as well as, the determination of President 
      Bush to establish the State of Palestine, side by side with Israel.       
        
      Sisters and brothers,
        
                Let us move to talk about the other part of the National Working 
      Program which our people and institutions have taken upon themselves to 
      realize since the establishment of the PNA, ten years ago. We would say 
      that the target was, and still is, to put the appropriate structure for 
      building a state that can provide a progressive model that befits the 
      capabilities of our people and their abilities, aspirations, hopes and 
      sacrifices.
        
                Our target was, and still is, to realize the dreams that we were 
      building upon, when we were in the diaspora and in the homeland, during 
      the years of revolution and national resistance to occupation. It is the 
      dream of resurrecting Palestine into a state that can take pride in its 
      progress, the creativity of its people, and its democracy so as to be a 
      minerate that makes sure that our people and Arab Nation will continue 
      their civilizational contributions in the march of the region and the 
      whole world.
        
                This task was intervening with and affecting the first i.e the 
      previous, task. The policies of the Israeli occupation, the siege and 
      destruction reflected negatively, and in a destructive manner, on all our 
      efforts. Despite the hindrances, obstacles and pre-conditions, we started, 
      upon the establishment of the PNA, from zero a comprehensive process of 
      construction of a homeland ravaged by the occupation into waste, 
      destruction, confiscation and building of colonial settlements and with 
      all kinds of racism.
        
                Over the last years, we started construction, and we started to 
      remove the rubble. We started re-construction. The achievements made on 
      the level of building schools and developing education; and on the health 
      level in terms of building new hospitals, developing the old ones, 
      modernizing their equipment and opening dozens of new clinics in the 
      various regions; and on the level of infrastructure in terms of opening 
      and asphalting roads, building networks of water and waste water, the 
      housing projects, and the industrial zones are examples on the capability 
      of our people and institutions and the work they have achieved.
        
                We adopted the open-doors-policy vis-&agrave;-vis the role of the 
      private sector. We used to start from the point where the others ended. 
      This has strengthened the role of the private sector, the greatest 
      generator of our economy. [Our people come from as far as Chile, Australia 
      and from other places to participate in the construction process]. The 
      private sector is the basic partner in the largest economic sectors such 
      as communications and electricity. It is the one that put the nucleus for 
      the big projects such as the Gaza sea-port and air-port, which started to 
      function, as you might remember, years ago. We provided all the conditions 
      for the development and growth of the national industries. We witnessed 
      great leaps in the sectors of construction and tourism especially during 
      our celebrations in Bethlehem in 2000 of the birth of our Lord, Jesus 
      Christ, peace upon him. [In these celebrations 28 heads of state and 
      government participated. We were able to bring together for the first time 
      the 13 churches. This was a historic achievement.] Our economy made new 
      indexes of growth. Many of these achievements have become, since many 
      years, targets for Israeli cannons and Israeli air planes rockets, thus 
      inflicting upon most of them total destruction.       
        
      Sisters and brothers,
        
                The chain of Israeli aggressions targeted the destruction of the 
      PNA by laying siege to and by destroying the headquarters. The 
      re-occupation of the West Bank and the continued incursions into the Gaza 
      Strip have generated a security vacuum in many areas as a result of 
      forbidding our forces and apparatus from carrying out their duties and as 
      a result of the havoc caused to these forces and apparatus by destroying 
      their headquarters, facilities and vehicles.
        
                This vacuum that the occupiers wanted to create in order to 
      implement their schemes, contributed to the creation of a state of 
      security chaos which jeopardized the security of the Palestinian citizen, 
      as well as to the absence of the rule of law.
        
                The big and fundamental responsibility that the occupation bears 
      for creating this situation, should not make us forget to do what is 
      possible and available in order to put an end to this situation and to 
      stop any transgressions that affect the citizen and the institutions. All 
      lawless practices have to stop because they give the Israeli government 
      the pretext to expand the scope of its aggression and to cause more harm 
      and destruction to the property of the Palestinian citizens. All have to 
      abide by the national decision and by the highest national interest, as 
      defined by the bodies and institutions of the PLO and the PNA.
        
      Sisters and brothers,
      Sons and daughters of our heroic and steadfast people,
        
                When we point out to the achievements made during the march of 
      the PNA; when we underline the obstructionist and destructive role played 
      by the Israeli occupation; when we point out the mistakes that usually 
      accompany the initial phases and the beginnings of construction; we have 
      to talk frankly to our people and have to be faithful with ourselves when 
      we point out to the sources of mistakes and shortcomings in our 
      performance especially in the wake of the programmed Israeli occupation, 
      building colonial settlements and destruction, including sequestering 
      revenues from our taxes for more than 40 months. [We are talking here of 
      billions of dollars. Average monthly income of the frozen revenues from 
      taxes by Israel is US$ 70 million. The agreement stipulates that the 
      Israelis take 3% service tax and transfer to us 97%. So you can calculate 
      the result now]. Despite all of that we have to hurry to rectify, 
      straighten out and correct these failings and shortcomings. Yes, these 
      were wrong and detested practices made by some institutions. Some people 
      have misused their positions and were unfaithful in their jobs. The 
      process of building up the institutions was not followed up as should be. 
      Not enough effort was exerted into furthering the rule of law and the 
      activation of the judicial system and into consecrating the principle of 
      accountability. We started now to deal with all these shortcomings.
        
                You remember that I talked to you in June 2002 when we launched 
      our programme of reforms as a Palestinian national task originating out of 
      the needs of our people. In your august PLC, you adopted a detailed 
      document detailing the aspired reforms for which the consecutive 
      governments worked and implemented many of its points. When we review the 
      steps made over the last two years, we are content to mention the 
      testimonies of the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and 
      the Donor Community. All of them praised the achievements on the financial 
      reform. They considered the administration of finance and the management 
      of the budget and public funds in our country to be among the best in the 
      region. These steps, made by my brother Dr. Salam Fayyad, to rectify many 
      issues and to consolidate sound rules make us proud in our transparency 
      and the efficiency in the management of public funds in our country.
        
                Here, I would like to point out to the magnificent work done, on 
      the level of learning and education, under Dr. NaÅfem Abu Humus and his 
      brothers in the Ministry, in the schools and universities of which we can 
      pride ourselves in the whole region, as well as in other fields despite 
      our difficult circumstances and the challenges that we face, especially 
      from this racist and oppressive occupation.
        
                On another level, the creation of the post of prime minister, 
      when I asked my brother and comrade-in-arms Abu Mazen-- [those who meet 
      him can bring him my greetings]-- to form the government last year, was a 
      sign of the natural growth of our nascent democratic system that is 
      targeted and under siege. It is a sign that underlines the separation of 
      powers and strengthens the dynamism of institutional action.
        
                Yet, what has been achieved is not enough. Ahead of us there is 
      a lot of work to do. Therefore, I would like, officially, to call upon you 
      to launch together today a workshop for comprehensive reforms, a workshop 
      that engulfs all aspects of work of our Authority, a workshop that seeks, 
      through a thorough programme of action, to achieve all that can be 
      achieved under continued occupation, siege and aggression.
        
      The comprehensive workshop of reform is based on the following three axes: 

        
      First: On the political level 
        
                During the march of the Palestinian revolution in the diaspora 
      we raised the slogan of Ågdemocracy in the jungle of guns.Åh We built 
      representative institutions, in which the Palestinian national 
      decision-making was made with the participation of all factions and 
      currents under the umbrella of the PLO. When we established the PNA, we 
      were not content with revolutionary legality, given to us by the 
      institutions of the PLO. We were determined to achieve popular legality by 
      going to the election boxes in order to consecrate the principles of 
      elections, democracy and the alteration of authority. We are proud of 
that.
        
                Over the territory of our national homeland, as we are building 
      our national entity, we have to renew our political system on the basis of 
      democracy that ensures political pluralism in all our Palestinian 
      organizations, freedom of expression and freedom of political activity 
      within the bounds of law.
        
                This makes it essential for us to legislate some necessary laws 
      in this regard, and to monitor the performance in order to ensure 
      democratic development in our country. The pillar in all this is to 
      consecrate the principle of elections. The PNA has acted to provide the 
      requirements for holding the presidential, legislative and local elections 
      (which were supposed to take place on 20 January 2003. They were supposed 
      to have taken place already in 1999 under the state of Palestine as I have 
      agreed with my late partner Yitzhak Rabin). It is very clear that the 
      Israeli occupation wants, by its incursions, aggressions and penetrations, 
      to put obstacles in the face of carrying out these elections.
        
                All this should not frustrate our determination. On the 
      contrary, we have to continue doing what should be done to hold these 
      elections on all the presidential, legislative, administrative and 
      organizational levels. We have to increase our contacts with the effective 
      international parties so as to force Israel, to make space for our people 
      to make their say as was done in the previous elections. We have to start 
      with the local elections (Mr. Jamal Shobaki, minister of local government) 
      whose requirements have been made. All federations, societies and civil 
      unions should activate themselves and hold their elections. Do not 
      persecute the Palestinian woman. Don't give here a quota. Give women their 
      rights. Women form 54% of the population. Women have their place at the 
      PNC. They have to be well placed in all our institutions.
        
                We are struggling to hold elections on all levels in order to 
      deepen democratic practices and to open the space for our people to raise 
      their voice, to elect their representatives, to give their vote of 
      confidence to the programs they support and to open the doors wide for the 
      young generations to seize the opportunity to serve our people.
        
                In this regard, I appeal to all forces, factions and currents, 
      to engage themselves in this process. The doors are open for them for 
      political, popular and organizational work without any conditions except 
      those put by law, and made within the framework of the oneness of 
      authority and of respecting the PNA and its commitments and out of the 
      concern to formulate a national consensus that protects the highest 
      national interests of our people as defined by the institutions of the PLO 
      and the PNA. As all know, we have made a good start with all the national 
      forces and factions and with those in the diaspora. We have all to be 
      careful not to provide the Israelis with any pretexts to continue their 
      aggression. We have to care to present a positive human image of our 
      peoplesÅf struggle and resistance to achieve their rights. In this regard 
      we have to effectively continue this march with all the Palestinian 
      factions in order to strengthen national unity to face the challenges. We 
      thank all the Arab efforts that are with us in this field.
        
      Second: On the level of security and the rule of law 
        
                We all understand that it is impossible to realize total 
      security in the wake of the ongoing Israeli occupation and aggression, 
      especially that the Israelis continue to put obstacles of various forms 
      and shapes to forbid us to achieve that security. This, however, should 
      not deter as from exerting our energies and efforts to provide our people 
      with the highest level of security.
                The national security council and the council of ministers 
      adopted recently a security plan that started to establish these security 
      apparatus, especially in the police force. We are seeking to provide them 
      with all the requirements for success. We have made some contacts in this 
      regard under the auspices of the Quartet. The Minister of the Interior has 
      made a series of transfers and appointments in the leadership of the 
      police force. I call upon you to legislate all the necessary laws to 
      ensure an effective and a disciplined performance in the work of the 
      security apparatus, so that these can carry out their role in reinstating 
      the prestige of the PNA, in implementing the law and in protecting the 
      security of the citizen from all parties.
                The decision to unify the security apparatus, their 
      reorganization and retraining aims at preparing them to carry out their 
      duties in putting an end to the security chaos and in providing security 
      to the citizens in their daily life. We have all to move together to 
      correct and rectify any wrong doing. There can be no overlooking in 
      matters that jeopardize the security of the citizen and his basic rights, 
      or in the exploitation of position. There will be no leniency with 
      breaking the law, or with threatening the security of citizens or with any 
      attack at their property or at state property and with all armed 
      manifestations and other practices that break the law. In this regard, all 
      recommendations made by the Legislative Council should be taken into 
      consideration. In this respect also, we have always to concentrate on 
      strengthening the rule of law. It is the fundamental pillar for work in 
      this regard.

                Over the last two years, we have made steps to reform the 
      judicial apparatus and the courts with the aim of strengthening their 
      independence and capabilities. Ahead of us lie many steps to be taken that 
      need to be consolidated and carried out so as to make the citizen feel the 
      existence of a security umbrella provided by law that is applicable to 
      all, starting with the President of the PNA and down to any citizen. No 
      one is above the law which should be carried out and protected by our 
      security apparatus only. Dear brother Abu AlaÅfa, I assure you of my total 
      support, and that of our people and of all of our official institutions, 
      for the work of your government in this regard.
        
      Third: On the level of Administrative and Financial Reform 
        
                The achievements made on this level, over the last years, 
      provide a firm base to achieve more in order to realize the highest 
      degrees of transparency, control and accountability as well as the 
      reevaluation of the cadres in our ministries and institutions with the aim 
      of development and the achievement of the principle of equal opportunities 
      and justice.

                In this regard, I urge your esteemed Council, to complete all 
      the laws necessary for financial and administrative control, unlawful 
      profit&#8211;making, retirement law and any other laws that, you feel, will 
      provide legal frameworks necessary in that regard. I assure you of total 
      cooperation with your Council. Any one who wants to hold me accountable 
      and discuss this on a bilateral level, or in a commission or in such a 
      meeting like this will find me ready for that.
        
                I would like, as well, to reaffirm the necessity to follow up 
      any issues pertaining to administrative or financial practices of wrong 
      doing. These should be immediately transferred to the attorney &#8211; general 
      as he is directed to follow up. We will not be forgiving or lenient in 
      this regard.
        
      Sisters and brothers,
        
                When we talk about this basket of reform we are not making any 
      favors to our people. Providing them with security, strengthening the rule 
      of law, sound performance in the management of public funds are rights to 
      be fulfilled.
               
      We do not make any favors. These are dues to be paid and commitments to be 
      carried out, because we were elected to achieve them. The consecutive 
      governments won your and our peoples vote of confidence on the basis of 
      programs prepared for their implementation.

                We have to put the task of alleviating the sufferings of our 
      people at the top of our program of action. We have to mobilize all our 
      energies and contacts with the countries of the world to provide us with 
      every possible support in order to ease the fierce economic crisis that we 
      are living through. I call upon my Arab brothers to continue implementing 
      the decisions and resolutions of the Arab summits on supporting the 
      Palestinian people. I thank the fraternal and friendly states which 
      support us continuously, especially the EU, Japan and China as well as the 
      other brothers and friends the world over for their ongoing support, 
      whether on the level of training our security and civilian cadres, or for 
      giving advice, or for receiving our delegations which go to these 
      countries to learn and gain experience.
        
      Sisters and brothers,
        
                While we call for the launching of a workshop for comprehensive 
      reform, we have to strengthen cooperation among our institutions. I 
      reaffirm here, and once more, my confidence in my brother and 
      comrade&#8211;in&#8211;arms Abu AlaÅfa and my total support for the work of his 
      government in all these fields. I convey, as well, greetings and 
      appreciation of your efforts at the PLC, and for your monitoring and 
      control and legislative roles which we consider a corner stone in our 
      political life, experience and democracy.
                Finally, while we remember the heroic martyrs who have laid 
      their lives so that their people would rise up and a free Palestine would 
      be resurrected, while we pay, once again, respectful greeting to our 
      heroes, the prisoners and detainees, who are making these days a new epic 
      in the annals of the imprisoned movement, I would like to say to our 
      people, to our resistant people, to this people, the people of exceeding 
      strength, to the steadfast people till the day of judgment, to the people 
      who hold firmly to their rights and dreams, to the people who own a 
      penetrating vision to confront the conspiracies, the first and the second 
      Sykes&#8211;Picot conspiracy, I say to our people, let us continue the march on 
      our road, in confidence, as we are accustomed to. Dawn will surely come. 
      The day of freedom will undoubtedly come.
                Together, and side by side, we will march until a young boy (a 
      cub) and a young girl (a flower) raise the banner of Palestine high at the 
      top of the minarets of Jerusalem and the churches of Jerusalem. They see 
      it a farfetched goal. We see it a close one.
        
      We will, without doubt, 
      Help Our apostles and those 
      Who believe, (both) 
      In this worldÅfs life
      And on the Day 
      When the Witnesses 
      Will stand forth,- 
        
      And We wished to be 
      Gracious to those who were 
      Being depressed in the land, 
      To make them leaders (in faith) 
      And make them heirs,,,, 
        
        
      And to enter your Temple 
      As they had entered it before, 
      And to visit with destruction 
      All that fell into their powers. 
        
      (It is) the promise of God. 
      Never does God depart 
      From His promise.
