Copyright laws are changing all over the world. Be sure to check the
copyright laws for your country before distributing this or any other
Project Gutenberg file.

We encourage you to keep this file, exactly as it is, on your
own disk, thereby keeping an electronic path open for future
readers.  Please do not remove this.

This header should be the first thing seen when anyone starts to
view the etext. Do not change or edit it without written permission.
The words are carefully chosen to provide users with the
information they need to understand what they may and may not
do with the etext.

Corrections for Version 11 of this text made by Steve Henshaw
and Andrew Sly.

Project Gutenberg Etexts are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep etexts in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our etexts one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or
http://promo.net/pg

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
etexts, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any Etext before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext03 or
ftp://ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext03

Or /etext02, 01, 00, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90

Just search by the first five letters of the filename you want,
as it appears in our Newsletters.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2001 as we release over 50 new Etext
files per month, or 500 more Etexts in 2000 for a total of 4000+
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
should reach over 300 billion Etexts given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000 = 1 Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

At our revised rates of production, we will reach only one-third
of that goal by the end of 2001, or about 4,000 Etexts.  We need
funding, as well as continued efforts by volunteers, to maintain
or increase our production and reach our goals.

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has been created
to secure a future for Project Gutenberg into the next millennium.

We need your donations more than ever!

*In Progress

We have filed in about 45 states now, but these are the only ones
that have responded.

As the requirements for other states are met, additions to this list
will be made and fund raising will begin in the additional states.
Please feel free to ask to check the status of your state.

In answer to various questions we have received on this:

We are constantly working on finishing the paperwork to legally
request donations in all 50 states.  If your state is not listed and
you would like to know if we have added it since the list you have,
just ask.

While we cannot solicit donations from people in states where we are
not yet registered, we know of no prohibition against accepting
donations from donors in these states who approach us with an offer to
donate.

International donations are accepted, but we don't know ANYTHING about
how to make them tax-deductible, or even if they CAN be made
deductible, and don't have the staff to handle it even if there are
ways.

**The Legal Small Print**


(Three Pages)

***START**THE SMALL PRINT!**FOR PUBLIC DOMAIN ETEXTS**START***
Why is this "Small Print!" statement here? You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault. So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you. It also tells you how
you may distribute copies of this etext if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement. If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from. If you received this etext on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etexts,
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market
any commercial products without permission.

To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] Michael Hart and the Foundation (and any other party you may
receive this etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims
all liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from. If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy. If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS ETEXT IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS". NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE ETEXT OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold Michael Hart, the Foundation,
and its trustees and agents, and any volunteers associated
with the production and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
texts harmless, from all liability, cost and expense, including
legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of the
following that you do or cause:  [1] distribution of this etext,
[2] alteration, modification, or addition to the etext,
or [3] any Defect.

DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"
You may distribute copies of this etext electronically, or by
disk, book or any other medium if you either delete this
"Small Print!" and all other references to Project Gutenberg,
or:

[1]  Only give exact copies of it.  Among other things, this
     requires that you do not remove, alter or modify the
     etext or this "small print!" statement.  You may however,
     if you wish, distribute this etext in machine readable
     binary, compressed, mark-up, or proprietary form,
     including any form resulting from conversion by word
     processing or hypertext software, but only so long as
     *EITHER*:

     [*]  The etext, when displayed, is clearly readable, and
          does *not* contain characters other than those
          intended by the author of the work, although tilde
          (~), asterisk (*) and underline (_) characters may
          be used to convey punctuation intended by the
          author, and additional characters may be used to
          indicate hypertext links; OR

     [*]  The etext may be readily converted by the reader at
          no expense into plain ASCII, EBCDIC or equivalent
          form by the program that displays the etext (as is
          the case, for instance, with most word processors);
          OR

     [*]  You provide, or agree to also provide on request at
          no additional cost, fee or expense, a copy of the
          etext in its original plain ASCII form (or in EBCDIC
          or other equivalent proprietary form).

[2]  Honor the etext refund and replacement provisions of this
     "Small Print!" statement.

[3]  Pay a trademark license fee to the Foundation of 20% of the
     gross profits you derive calculated using the method you
     already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  If you
     don't derive profits, no royalty is due.  Royalties are
     payable to "Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation"
     the 60 days following each date you prepare (or were
     legally required to prepare) your annual (or equivalent
     periodic) tax return.  Please contact us beforehand to
     let us know your plans and to work out the details.

利用上のきまりと著作権
ほとんどすべての利用が無条件に許されているんだけれども、それじゃあなんか不安、というひとのために。
1. [原則] ここに「枯葉」が翻訳提供する各ファイルを、そのファイルに特別な指示のないかぎり、「あなた」は、利用の形式を問わず、「枯葉」の許可を得ることなく、あらゆるメディアを通じて利用することができます。特別な指示のないかぎり、あらゆる配布とあらゆる改変を「枯葉」は無条件に認めます。
2. [著作権者の希望] ただし、版権部分の削除をするべきではありません。ここに翻訳提供されているファイルの版権部分は、それらのファイルが自由に利用できることを証明する唯一の部分です。それらを削除した場合、「あなた」が合法的にそのファイルを利用している根拠が失われることになります。なお、具体的に「版権部分」とは、「Copyright」で始まる各文を指します。できれば、ファイルの状態を明示的に示すために、「原文：」から版権部分までを残しておいてくださるよう「枯葉」は望みます。■2001.5.15補記。これは縛りとして厳しすぎた。要するに「原著者の著作権が失効していて」「二次著作権者（要はオレ）が著作権法に基づく規制の適用に同意しない」ことを明記してくれればそれでよろしゅうございます。
3. [原著者の著作権] 著作権については、まず、原著者の著作権は死後50年を経て失効しています(expired)。もし原著者の著作権が失効していない場合は、そのファイルに詳細を明記します。
4. [訳者の著作権] 「枯葉」の著作権は自然発生していますが、「枯葉」による著作権の行使は全面的に差し控えられています(waived)。日本の著作権法では著作権の放棄ができないということで、「差し控える」という表現にしています。詳しく言えば、ここに翻訳提供されているファイルは「著作財産権」が放棄されているものの、「著作人格権」が放棄されていない（できない）という状態にあります。したがって、2.を守らなかった場合は著作同一性保持義務違反となる可能性があります。もちろん、それに対抗するための著作権行使は「差し控え」ますけれども、あまりにも悪質な場合はそのかぎりではありません。
5. [著作権者が怒りそうな行為の具体例] あまりにも悪質な場合、というのも曖昧でいい加減ですから、具体的に想定例を挙げますと、ここに翻訳提供されているファイルに勝手に著作権を主張し、それによって「枯葉」を著作権の侵犯で訴える、などといった行為を想定してのものです。もし万が一そのような人物が出てきたとしたら、個人的には放置プレイ＆人間観察の対象にしてみたい気持ちはありますが、そうも言っておられないかと思われます。
6. [翻訳以外のファイルの改変・再配布] ここに提供されているものの、翻訳ではないファイルについては、引用すればすむものと思われますので、改変や再配布を禁じます。万一再配布したいというものがあれば、何に使うのかを説明することで「枯葉」の好奇心を満たしてやってください。それが「枯葉」にとって面白ければ、許可されることでしょう。
7. [免責] 法律は改正される可能性があり、また「枯葉」の法律理解に誤りがある可能性もあります。したがって、ここに書いたことは暫定的なものであり、将来にまたがる有効性を「枯葉」により保証されたものではありません。また、「枯葉」は翻訳の正しさについて一切責任を負いません（良心の痛みくらいは感じますけれども）。また、利用にあたって生じた損害（例「悪魔の辞典」を引用しまくったら友だちをなくした）は、「枯葉」はこれを補償しません。
8. [フィードバックとクレジット] 誤字誤訳誤日本語の指摘を歓迎します。別記謝辞にお名前を挙げるようにしていますが、その際、メール本文中で名乗られている名前を使わせていただきます（ない場合はシグニチャ、それもなければ「某氏」）。フルネームについては苗字のみ、という書き方をしていましたが、よく考えると失礼千万な真似です。ごめんなさい。以後はフルネームで記載することにします。もし「枯葉」が不都合な書き方をした（している）場合は、遠慮なくお叱りのメールをお送りください。匿名が希望の方はその旨明記してくださればそのように取り計らいます。その他、感想・宣伝・投石など諸々のフィードバックも歓迎します。非好意的なものであってもかまいません。「読まれている」という認識がなによりも「枯葉」を喜ばせます。でも投石はちょっと嫌かな。投宝石とかだったら打たれながらもさもしく拾わせていただきますが。
以上。「これ考え方としておかしい」というのがあればご一報を。
