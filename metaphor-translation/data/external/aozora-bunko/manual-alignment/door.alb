Description of Services 
This website provides access to a range of online content for personal, research or teaching use and allows users to submit material which may be published on the website or distributed by email ('Services').
Disclaimer 
To the fullest extent permitted by law, your use of and access to the website and any material downloaded or otherwise obtained from the site is entirely at your own risk; the site's services are provided on an 'as is' and 'as available' basis.

You agree to indemnify Hyperfiction (and its employees) against any and all liability, costs, damages and losses (including legal fees incurred and any compensation paid by Hyperfiction) incurred by Hyperfiction as a result of any actual or alleged breach by you of any of these terms of service.

Submissions, Comments & Forum Posts 
By submitting a story or a comment to the site or a post to a forum (the 'Work'), you:
Agree to grant Hyperfiction a non-exclusive licence to publish the Work on the site. You may terminate this licence agreement with one (1) month's notice to Hyperfiction. Notice should be delivered by email or post. In the case of email, this notice will be deemed to have been received on receipt of an electronic confirmation of delivery to you by Hyperfiction. In the case of post, this notice will be deemed to have been received five (5) business days after posting. Copyright on the Work remains with the author of the Work. 
Warrant that: 
The Work is original work, it has not been copied wholly or substantially from any other work or material and publication by Hyperfiction of the Work on the site will not infringe the intellectual property rights of any third party in any country of the world. 
You are entitled to grant Hyperfiction a non-exclusive licence to publish the Work on the site.

The Work contains nothing that breaks any applicable national, local or international law. 
In the case of all work not explicitly labelled as non-fiction, the characters in the Work are all fictitious and any resemblance to any person, living or dead is purely coincidental. 
The work does not contain an advertisement, chain letter or pyramid scheme. 

Acknowledge that the Work will be subject to criticism both by Hyperfiction and by users of the Services and Hyperfiction reserves the right to publish any criticism of the Work at its discretion and cannot guarantee that such criticism will be constructive. If you are likely to take offence at certain criticism you should not submit the Work to Hyperfiction.

You may use such content and intellectual property in accordance with these terms of service, only to the extent necessary to receive the Services. 

Sale Of Electronic Items 
Price information is subject to change without notice.
No contract will exist between you and Hyperfiction for the sale by Hyperfiction to you of any item on the site until Hyperfiction has sent you an email confirming acceptance of your order. This email will be deemed to have arrived at the time Hyperfiction sends it to you.

Delivery Of Electronic Items 
Once an electronic item has been purchased, it will be made available for downloading at a page on the site (the 'Bookshelf' associated with the purchase). The item will remain available for downloading on this Bookshelf for a period of at least 28 days after its purchase (subject to the above disclaimer).
