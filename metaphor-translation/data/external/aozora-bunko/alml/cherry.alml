Copyright laws are changing all over the world, be sure to check
the copyright laws for your country before posting these files!!

Please take a look at the important information in this header.
We encourage you to keep this file on your own disk, keeping an
electronic path open for the next readers.  Do not remove this.


**Welcome To The World of Free Plain Vanilla Electronic Texts**

**Etexts Readable By Both Humans and By Computers, Since 1971**

*These Etexts Prepared By Hundreds of Volunteers and Donations*

Information on contacting Project Gutenberg to get Etexts, and
further information is included below.  We need your donations.


Kwaidan:  Stories and Studies of Strange Things

By Lafcadio Hearn

February, 1998  [Etext #1210]


***The Project Gutenberg Etext of Kwaidan, by Lafcadio Hearn***
*****This file should be named kwidn10.txt or kwidn10.zip******

Corrected EDITIONS of our etexts get a new NUMBER, kwidn11.txt
VERSIONS based on separate sources get new LETTER, kwidn10a.txt


Project Gutenberg Etexts are usually created from multiple editions,
all of which are in the Public Domain in the United States, unless a
copyright notice is included.  Therefore, we do NOT keep these books
in compliance with any particular paper edition, usually otherwise.


We are now trying to release all our books one month in advance
of the official release dates, for time for better editing.

Please note:  neither this list nor its contents are final till
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.  To be sure you have an
up to date first edition [xxxxx10x.xxx] please check file sizes
in the first week of the next month.  Since our ftp program has
a bug in it that scrambles the date [tried to fix and failed] a
look at the file size will have to do, but we will try to see a
new copy has at least one byte more or less.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-two text
files per month, or 384 more Etexts in 1998 for a total of 1500+
If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the
total should reach over 150 billion Etexts given away.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only 10% of the present number of computer users.  2001
should have at least twice as many computer users as that, so it
will require us reaching less than 5% of the users in 2001.


We need your donations more than ever!

***START**THE SMALL PRINT!**FOR PUBLIC DOMAIN ETEXTS**START***
Why is this "Small Print!" statement here?  You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement.  If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from.  If you received this etext on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-
tm etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor
Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at
Carnegie-Mellon University (the "Project").  Among other
things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
under the Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] the Project (and any other party you may receive this
etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from.  If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy.  If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS ETEXT IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS".  NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE ETEXT OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold the Project, its directors,
officers, members and agents harmless from all liability, cost
and expense, including legal fees, that arise directly or
indirectly from any of the following that you do or cause:
[1] distribution of this etext, [2] alteration, modification,
or addition to the etext, or [3] any Defect.

DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"
You may distribute copies of this etext electronically, or by
disk, book or any other medium if you either delete this
"Small Print!" and all other references to Project Gutenberg,
or:

[1]  Only give exact copies of it.  Among other things, this
     requires that you do not remove, alter or modify the
     etext or this "small print!" statement.  You may however,
     if you wish, distribute this etext in machine readable
     binary, compressed, mark-up, or proprietary form,
     including any form resulting from conversion by word pro-
     cessing or hypertext software, but only so long as
     *EITHER*:

     [*]  The etext, when displayed, is clearly readable, and
          does *not* contain characters other than those
          intended by the author of the work, although tilde
          (~), asterisk (*) and underline (_) characters may
          be used to convey punctuation intended by the
          author, and additional characters may be used to
          indicate hypertext links; OR

     [*]  The etext may be readily converted by the reader at
          no expense into plain ASCII, EBCDIC or equivalent
          form by the program that displays the etext (as is
          the case, for instance, with most word processors);
          OR

     [*]  You provide, or agree to also provide on request at
          no additional cost, fee or expense, a copy of the
          etext in its original plain ASCII form (or in EBCDIC
          or other equivalent proprietary form).

[2]  Honor the etext refund and replacement provisions of this
     "Small Print!" statement.

[3]  Pay a trademark license fee to the Project of 20% of the
     net profits you derive calculated using the method you
     already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  If you
     don't derive profits, no royalty is due.  Royalties are
     payable to "Project Gutenberg Association/Carnegie-Mellon
     University" within the 60 days following each
     date you prepare (or were legally required to prepare)
     your annual (or equivalent periodic) tax return.

WHAT IF YOU *WANT* TO SEND MONEY EVEN IF YOU DON'T HAVE TO?
The Project gratefully accepts contributions in money, time,
scanning machines, OCR software, public domain etexts, royalty
free copyright licenses, and every other sort of contribution
you can think of.  Money should be paid to "Project Gutenberg
Association / Carnegie-Mellon University".

嘘のよな　十六桜　咲きにけり 
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
伊予の国の和気郡には「十六桜」、あるいは「十六日の桜の木」と呼ばれる有名な大変古い桜の木がある。
</J><E>
In Wakegori, a district of the province of Iyo (1), there is a very ancient and famous cherry-tree, called Jiu-roku-zakura, or "the Cherry-tree of the Sixteenth Day," 
</E></T>
<T><J>
その木は毎年（昔の太陰暦で）一月十六日に開花し、その日のうちに散る。
</J><E>
because it blooms every year upon the sixteenth day of the first month (by the old lunar calendar),-- and only upon that day.
</E></T>
<T><J>
したがって本来の桜ならば春まで待つところを、その桜は大寒の時期に開花するのである。
</J><E>
Thus the time of its flowering is the Period of Great Cold,-- though the natural habit of a cherry-tree is to wait for the spring season before venturing to blossom.
</E></T>
<T><J>
十六桜は自らのものではない命―少なくとも、もとはそれ自らの命ではなかった―をもって咲く。
</J><E>
But the Jiu-roku-zakura blossoms with a life that is not -- or, at least, that was not originally -- its own. 
</E></T>
<T><J>
その木には、ある男の魂が宿っているのだ。
</J><E>
There is the ghost of a man in that tree.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
その男は伊予の国の侍であった。
</J><E>
He was a samurai of Iyo;
</E></T>
<T><J>
木は男の庭で育ち、
</J><E>
and the tree grew in his garden;
</E></T>
<T><J>
かつては並の時期（つまりは三月の終わりや四月の初め）に咲いていた。
</J><E>
and it used to flower at the usual time,-- that is to say, about the end of March or the beginning of April.
</E></T>
<T><J>
男は子供の時分にその木の下で遊び、
</J><E>
He had played under that tree when he was a child;
</E></T>
<T><J>
季節が百たび以上もめぐる間、男の両親や祖父母、先祖たちは咲き誇る枝に賛美の句を記した明るい色紙の短冊をつるした。
</J><E>
and his parents and grandparents and ancestors had hung to its blossoming branches, season after season for more than a hundred years, bright strips of colored paper inscribed with poems of praise. 
</E></T>
<T><J>
男もまた年老いた。
</J><E>
He himself became very old,
</E></T>
<T><J>
その子供にはみな先立たれ、
</J><E>
-- outliving all his children; 
</E></T>
<T><J>
この世に男が慈しむものとて、その木の他に残されてはいなかった。
</J><E>
and there was nothing in the world left for him to live except that tree.
</E></T>
<T><J>
それがなんと、ある年の夏に萎え、枯れてしまったではないか。
</J><E>
And lo! in the summer of a certain year, the tree withered and died!
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
老人はその木のため、大いに嘆いた。
</J><E>
Exceedingly the old man sorrowed for his tree.
</E></T>
<T><J>
親切な近所の者たちは慰めになればと、美しい桜の若木を見つけ、その庭に植えてやった。
</J><E>
Then kind neighbors found for him a young and beautiful cherry-tree, and planted it in his garden,-- hoping thus to comfort him.
</E></T>
<T><J>
老人は感謝して、喜ぶふりをした。
</J><E>
And he thanked them, and pretended to be glad.
</E></T>
<T><J>
しかし本心は悲嘆に暮れていた。
</J><E>
But really his heart was full of pain;
</E></T>
<T><J>
その古い桜をこよなく愛していたため、老人にとって、何物もその木に引き替えることはできなかったのだ。
</J><E>
for he had loved the old tree so well that nothing could have consoled him for the loss of it.
</E></T>
<T><J>
ついに、老人によい考えが浮かんだ。
</J><E>
At last there came to him a happy thought:
</E></T>
<T><J>
枯れゆく木をあるいは救えるかもしれぬ術を思いついたのだ。
</J><E>
he remembered a way by which the perishing tree might be saved.
</E></T>
<T><J>
（それが一月十六日だった。）
</J><E>
(It was the sixteenth day of the first month.)
</E></T>
<T><J>
老人はただ一人庭にゆき、しおれた木の前で礼をし、こう語りかけた。
</J><E>
Along he went into his garden, and bowed down before the withered tree, and spoke to it, saying:
</E></T>
<T><J>
「そら、頼むからわしの願いを聞き入れ、もう一度咲いてくれ。
</J><E>
"Now deign, I beseech you, once more to bloom,
</E></T>
<T><J>
お前の代りに死んでやるのだからな」
</J><E>
-- because I am going to die in your stead."
</E></T>
<T><J>
（神の取り計らいによって、人は他の人間、動物、はては木にさえ、魂を移すことができると信じられていた。
</J><E>
(For it is believed that one can really give away one's life to another person, or to a creature or even to a tree, by the favor of the gods;
</E></T>
<T><J>
このように魂を移すことは「身代わりに立つ」という言葉で、代わりになるということを表現される。）
</J><E>
-- and thus to transfer one's life is expressed by the term migawari ni tatsu, "to act as a substitute.") 
</E></T>
<T><J>
そして木の下に白布と様々の覆いを広げ、その上に座り、武士の作法に従って切腹したのだった。
</J><E>
Then under that tree he spread a white cloth, and divers coverings, and sat down upon the coverings, and performed hara-kiri after the fashion of a samurai.
</E></T>
<T><J>
侍の魂は木の中に入り、花を同じ時間に咲かせるようになった。
</J><E>
And the ghost of him went into the tree, and made it blossom in that same hour.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
そしてその木はいまだに毎年、一月十六日の雪の時節に花咲かせるのである。 
</J><E>
And every year it still blooms on the sixteenth day of the first month, in the season of snow.
