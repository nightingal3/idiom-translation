Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or
http://promo.net/pg

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext03 or
ftp://ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext03

Or /etext02, 01, 00, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90

Just search by the first five letters of the filename you want,
as it appears in our Newsletters.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

Here is the briefest record of our progress (* means estimated):

ふとっちょあらいぐまの家
</J><E>
FATTY COON AT HOME
</E></T>
<T><J>
1 ふとっちょあらいぐまは、とても太っていてまん丸で、まるで毛皮のボールのよう、そこに取っ手ではなく、羽かざりのようなしっぽがついた姿をしていました。
</J><E>
1  Fatty Coon was so fat and round that he looked like a ball of fur, with a plumelike tail for a handle. 
</E></T>
<T><J>
しかしまぢかに寄って見てみますと、するどくかがやくふたつの目が、あなたをじっと見かえしているのに、お気づきになるでしょう。
</J><E>
But if you looked at him closely you would have seen a pair of very bright eyes watching you.
</E></T>
<T><J>
2 ふとっちょは食べることが大好きでした。
</J><E>
2 Fatty loved to eat. 
</E></T>
<T><J>
そう
</J><E>
Yes
</E></T>
<T><J>
――世界中のなによりも、食べることが好きでした。
</J><E>
--he loved eating better than anything else in the world. 
</E></T>
<T><J>
ひどく太っているのはそのせいでした。
</J><E>
That was what made him so fat. 
</E></T>
<T><J>
そしてたくさんの冒険をすることになったのもまた、そのせいでした。
</J><E>
And that, too, was what led him into many adventures. 
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
3 ふとっちょあらいぐまは、お母さんと弟とふたりの妹といっしょに、ブルー山とスウィフト川のあいだの谷間に横たわる沼の近くに住んでいました。
</J><E>
3 Close by a swamp, which lay down in the valley, between Blue Mountain and Swift River, Fatty Coon lived with his mother and his brother and his two sisters.
</E></T>
<T><J>
一家はそのあたりに住んでいた大人たちみんなのあいだで、『強力るいじ家系』と呼ばれていました。
</J><E>
A mong them all there was what grown people call "a strong family resemblance," 
</E></T>
<T><J>
一家全員がとてもよく似ている、というのと同じ意味です。
</J><E>
which is the same thing as saying that they all looked very much a like.
</E></T>
<T><J>
彼らそれぞれのしっぽに
</J><E>
The tail of each one of them
</E></T>
<T><J>
――お母さんに子どもたちも
</J><E>
--mother and children too
</E></T>
<T><J>
――六つの黒い輪っかのもようがついていました。
</J><E>
--had six black rings around it.
</E></T>
<T><J>
それぞれの顔は、黒い布切れを横にわたしたように毛が生えていて、まるでマスクをしているように見えました。
</J><E>
Each of them had a dark brown patch of fur across the face, like a mask.
</E></T>
<T><J>
それに、彼らそれぞれが――どう思います？　
</J><E>
And--what do you think?--each of them,
</E></T>
<T><J>
――ふとっちょに弟に妹たちまでもが、かたくて白い口ひげを生やしていました！
</J><E>
even Fatty and his brother and his sisters, had a stiff, white moustache! 
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
4 一家はみなとてもよく似た姿をしていたとはいうものの、もちろんみなさんはおわかりでしょうが、あらいぐま夫人は子どもたちに比べるとずっと大きな体でした。
</J><E>
4 Of course, though they all looked so much alike, you would have known which was Mrs. Coon, for she was so much bigger than her children.
</E></T>
<T><J>
そして、おわかりでしょう、ふとっちょは――弟や妹たちよりもずっとまん丸な体でした。
</J><E>
And you would have known which was Fatty--he was so much rounder than his brother and his sisters. 
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
5 あらいぐま夫人の家は、古い木の枝に空いたうろの中にありました。
</J><E>
5 Mrs. Coon's home was in the hollow branch of an old tree.
</E></T>
<T><J>
それは巨大な木で
</J><E>
It was a giant of a tree
</E></T>
<T><J>
――そのポプラの木は、沼に流れこむ小川のそばに立っていました
</J><E>
--a poplar close by a brook which ran into the swamp
</E></T>
<T><J>
――枝のうろの中のあらいぐま夫人の家は、ふつうの木の幹に空いたうろの中と同じくらいの広さがありました。
</J><E>
--and the branch which was Mrs. Coon's home was as big as most tree-trunks are. 
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
6 黒っちょは、ふとっちょの弟です
</J><E>
6 Blackie was Fatty's brother
</E></T>
<T><J>
――顔のマスクの色が、ほかの者よりもほんの少しだけ黒かったからです。
</J><E>
--for the mask on his face was just a little darker than the others'.
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふわっちょは、ふとっちょの妹の一ぴきです。
</J><E>
Fluffy was one of Fatty's sisters,
</E></T>
<T><J>
毛皮が、ほかの子どもよりほんの少しだけふわふわだったからです。
</J><E>
because her fur was just a little fluffier than the other children's.
</E></T>
<T><J>
もう一ぴきの妹の名前は、かわいっちょです。
</J><E>
And Cutey was the other sister's name,
</E></T>
<T><J>
なぜなら、たいそうかわいかったからです。
</J><E>
because she was so quaint.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
7 さて、ふとっちょあらいぐまは、いつでも食べものを探しまわっていました。
</J><E>
7 Now, Fatty Coon was forever looking around for something to eat.
</E></T>
<T><J>
お母さんがふとっちょのために家に持ちかえる食べもので満足したことなど、決してありませんでした。
</J><E>
He was never satisfied with what his mother brought home for him. 
</E></T>
<T><J>
あらいぐま夫人がどんなに大きなごちそうを家族の前に置こうと、ふとっちょは自分の分け前をたちまち平らげてしまいました。
</J><E>
No matter how big a dinner Mrs. Coon set before her family, as soon as he had finished eating his share 
</E></T>
<T><J>
そして、ていねいに白い口ひげをふき
</J><E>
Fatty would wipe his white moustache carefully
</E></T>
<T><J>
――どこからどう見ても老紳士のようです
</J><E>
--for all the world like some old gentleman
</E></T>
<T><J>
――もっと食べものを探しに、いそいそと出かけていくのでした。
</J><E>
--and hurry off in search of something more. 
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
8 あるときはふとっちょは小川の川べりに行き、するどいかぎづめで水の中の魚を引っかけて、つかまえようとしました。
</J><E>
Sometimes he went to the edge of the brook and tried to catch fish by hooking them out of the water with his sharp claws. 
</E></T>
<T><J>
またあるときは沼に出かけ、背の高いアシの中にかくれているカモをつかまえようとしました。
</J><E>
Sometimes he went over to the swamp and hunted for duck among the tall reeds.
</E></T>
<T><J>
カモのつかまえ方はまだ知りませんでしたが、カエルならばいつも一ぴきか二ひきはつかまえられました。
</J><E>
And though he did not yet know how to catch a duck, he could always capture a frog or two;
</E></T>
<T><J>
そして、まるで何日もひと口も食べたことがないようなようすで、つかまえたカエルをむしゃむしゃ食べるのでした。
</J><E>
and Fatty ate them as if he hadn't had a mouthful of food for days.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
9 本当のことを申しますと、ふとっちょはとれるものならほとんどなんでも食べました
</J><E>
To tell the truth, Fatty would eat almost anything he could get
</E></T>
<T><J>
――木の実、サクランボ、野ブドウ、ヤブイチゴ、虫、小さなヘビ、魚、ニワトリ、ハチミツ
</J><E>
--nuts, cherries, wild grapes, blackberries, bugs, small snakes, fish, chickens, honey
</E></T>
<T><J>
――ふとっちょが好きな食べものの種類はさまざまあり、きりがありませんでした。
</J><E>
--there was no end to the different kinds of food he liked.
</E></T>
<T><J>
なんでもかんでも食べました。
</J><E>
He ate everything.
</E></T>
<T><J>
そして、いつももっとなにか食べたいと思っていました。
</J><E>
And he always wanted more.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
10 「これで全部なの？」
</J><E>
"Is this all there is?"
</E></T>
<T><J>
ある日、ふとっちょあらいぐまはお母さんにたずねました。
</J><E>
Fatty Coon asked his mother one day.
</E></T>
<T><J>
あらいぐま夫人がふとっちょのために持ちかえったおいしい魚を、きれいにむさぼり食べたあとのことでした。
</J><E>
He had gobbled up every bit of the nice fish that Mrs. Coon had brought home for him.
</E></T>
<T><J>
それはじつにあっというまのことでした。
</J><E>
It was gone in no time at all.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
11 あらいぐま夫人はため息をつきました。
</J><E>
Mrs. Coon sighed.
</E></T>
<T><J>
もういく度となくその質問を聞いてきたからです。
</J><E>
She had heard that question so many times; 
</E></T>
<T><J>
一度でよいから、ふとっちょが欲しがるだけごちそうをたらふく食べさせてやれればいいのにと思っていたのです。
</J><E>
and she wished that for once Fatty might have all the dinner he wanted.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
12 「そうなんだよ
</J><E>
"Yes
</E></T>
<T><J>
――これで全部なんだよ」
</J><E>
--that's all,"
</E></T>
<T><J>
あらいぐま夫人は言いました。
</J><E>
she said,
</E></T>
<T><J>
.「お前くらいの子どもはこれで十分なはずだろう」
</J><E>
"and I should think that it was enough for a young coon like you."
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
13 ふとっちょはそれ以上なにも言いませんでした。
</J><E>
Fatty said nothing more. 
</E></T>
<T><J>
彼は口ひげを手の甲でぬぐうと（みなさんは真似しないでくださいね！）、ひと言もいわずに、食べものをさがしに出かけました。
</J><E>
He wiped his moustache on the back of his hand (I hope you'll never do that!) and without another word he started off to see what he could find to eat.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
II
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょ、卵について学ぶ
</J><E>
FATTY LEARNS SOMETHING ABOUT EGGS
</E></T>
<T><J>
1 お母さんが持ちかえった魚を食べおわり、もっとたくさんの食べものをさがしにひとりで出かけたとき、ふとっちょあらいぐまはこれが冒険になることを知りませんでした。
</J><E>
When Fatty Coon started off alone to find something more to eat, after finishing the fish that his mother had brought home for him, he did not know that he was going to have an adventure.
</E></T>
<T><J>
彼はやぶや背の高い草のあいだをかぎまわり、数ひきの虫と、一、二ひきのカエルをつかまえました。
</J><E>
He nosed about among the bushes and the tall grasses and caught a few bugs and a frog or two.
</E></T>
<T><J>
でもそんなものではもの足りないと思いました。
</J><E>
But he didn't think that THAT was much.
</E></T>
<T><J>
地面をはいずりまわっていても、あまり幸運にめぐまれそうにありませんでした。
</J><E>
He didn't seem to have much luck, down on the ground.
</E></T>
<T><J>
そこでリスの巣か鳥の卵をさがそうと、背の高いヘムロックの木に登りました。
</J><E>
So he climbed a tall hemlock, to see if he could find a squirrel's nest, or some bird's eggs.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
2 ふとっちょは木登りが大好きでした。
</J><E>
Fatty loved to climb trees.
</E></T>
<T><J>
ヘムロックの大木に登り、ほどなくすると、彼は腹ぺこを忘れてしまいました。
</J><E>
Up in the big hemlock he forgot, for a time, that he was still hungry.
</E></T>
<T><J>
枝がゆらゆらとゆれ、あかるい陽光が背中をぽかぽかと温めて、とてもよい心地でした。
</J><E>
It was delightful to feel the branches swaying under him, and the bright sunshine was warm upon his back.
</E></T>
<T><J>
木のてっぺん近くまで登ると、ふとっちょはまっすぐな木の幹に体を巻きつけました。
</J><E>
He climbed almost to the very tip-top of the tree and wound himself around the straight stem.
</E></T>
<T><J>
木の葉が厚くしげり、ばねのようにしなる枝が、彼の体を安全に包みこみました。
</J><E>
The thick, springy branches held him safely, 
</E></T>
<T><J>
彼はまもなくぐっすりと眠りこみました。
</J><E>
and soon Fatty was fast asleep.
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょは食べることの次に眠ることが好きでした。
</J><E>
Next to eating, Fatty loved sleeping.
</E></T>
<T><J>
彼はまもなく大きないびきをかきはじめました。
</J><E>
And now he had a good nap.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
3 ようやくふとっちょあらいぐまは目をさましました。
</J><E>
Fatty Coon woke up at last, 
</E></T>
<T><J>
あくびをし、木の幹に巻きつけていた体をそろそろとほどきました。
</J><E>
yawned, and slowly unwound himself from the stem of the tree.
</E></T>
<T><J>
今ではとてつもなくお腹が空いていました。
</J><E>
He was terribly hungry now. 
</E></T>
<T><J>
ただちに食べものを見つけなくてはだめだと感じました。
</J><E>
And he felt that he simply MUST find something to eat at once.
</E></T>
<T><J>
4 ふとっちょは地面に下りることなしに隣りの大木のてっぺんにわたり、すべての枝のあいだをくまなくさがそうと、つぶらなビーズのような目を光らせました。
</J><E>
Without going down to the ground, Fatty climbed over into the top of another big tree and his little beady, bright eyes began searching all the branches carefully.
</E></T>
<T><J>
彼はすぐさま笑みをうかべました。
</J><E>
Pretty soon Fatty smiled.
</E></T>
<T><J>
どうしてかというと、よろこんだからです。
</J><E>
He smiled because he was pleased.
</E></T>
<T><J>
どうしてよろこんだのかというと、まさにお目当てのものを見つけたからです。
</J><E>
And he was pleased because he saw exactly what he had been looking for. 
</E></T>
<T><J>
それほど離れていない下方に、小枝を組んで木の皮とコケをしきつめた大きな鳥の巣がありました。
</J><E>
Not far below him was a big nest, built of sticks and lined with bark and moss.
</E></T>
<T><J>
カラスの巣だ、とふとっちょは考えました。
</J><E>
It was a crow's nest, Fatty decided, 
</E></T>
<T><J>
彼は木のまたにかかった巣に向かって、さっさとすべり下りていきました。
</J><E>
and he lost no time in slipping down to the crotch of the tree where the nest was perched.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
5 巣の中には四個の白い卵がありました
</J><E>
There were four white eggs in the nest
</E></T>
<T><J>
――ふとっちょがこれまで見たうちで一番大きなカラスの卵でした。
</J><E>
--the biggest crow's eggs Fatty had ever seen.
</E></T>
<T><J>
彼は意地きたなく食べはじめました。
</J><E>
And he began to eat them hungrily.
</E></T>
<T><J>
鼻が卵まみれになりましたが、ぜんぜん気にしませんでした。
</J><E>
His nose became smeared with egg, but he didn't mind that at all.
</E></T>
<T><J>
なんておいしい卵なんだろう、とばかり考えていました
</J><E>
He kept thinking how good the eggs tasted
</E></T>
<T><J>
――そして、この卵がもっとたくさんあればいいのになあと思いました。
</J><E>
--and how he wished there were more of them.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
6 とつぜん、なにかが高い木の枝えだのあいだをぬって襲いかかってきました。
</J><E>
There was a sudden rush through the branches of the tall tree. 
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょあらいぐまの頭上を、強い風がさっと吹きぬけました。
</J><E>
And Fatty Coon caught a hard blow on his head.
</E></T>
<T><J>
同時に、なにかするどいものがふとっちょの背中をぐさりと突きさしました。
</J><E>
He felt something sharp sink into his back, too.
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょは落っこちないように巣のはしにしがみつきました。
</J><E>
And he clutched at the edge of the nest to keep from falling.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
7 ふとっちょはおどろきました。
</J><E>
Fatty was surprised,
</E></T>
<T><J>
ひかえ目に言っても、カラスがこんなふうに攻撃してくるとは聞いたこともありませんでしたから。
</J><E>
to say the least, for he had never known crows to fight like that.
</E></T>
<T><J>
彼はこわくなりました。
</J><E>
And he was frightened,
</E></T>
<T><J>
背中を傷つけられたからです。
</J><E>
because his back hurt. 
</E></T>
<T><J>
巣から手を放したら下に落っこちそうでおそろしかったので、戦えそうにありませんでした。
</J><E>
He couldn't fight, because he was afraid he would fall if he let go of the nest.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
8 できるかぎりはやく走って、家に逃げかえるよりほかにありません。
</J><E>
There was nothing to do but run home as fast as he could. 
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょは急ごうとしました。
</J><E>
Fatty tried to hurry;
</E></T>
<T><J>
けれど鳥が、彼の背中を叩いたり引っかいたり、あっちに引っぱったりこっちに引っぱったりしました。
</J><E>
but there was that bird, beating and clawing his back, and pulling him first one way and then another.
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょは二度と家にかえれないのだと思いはじめました。
</J><E>
He began to think he would never reach home.
</E></T>
<T><J>
けれどとうとうお母さんのいる古いポプラの木にたどり着きました。
</J><E>
But at last he came to the old poplar where his mother lived.
</E></T>
<T><J>
大きな枝のうろにたどり着くと、まもなくふとっちょは大いに安心しました。
</J><E>
And soon, to his great joy, he reached the hole in the big branch;
</E></T>
<T><J>
暗がりの中にすべり込んでふとっちょが大よろこびしたのを、みなさんもご想像がつくでしょう。
</J><E>
and you may well believe that Fatty was glad to slip down into the darkness 
</E></T>
<T><J>
そこではお母さんと、弟の黒っちょと、ふわっちょとかわいっちょの妹たちが、そろってぐっすりと眠っていました。
</J><E>
where his mother, and his brother Blackie, and Fluffy and Cutey his sisters, were all fast asleep.
</E></T>
<T><J>
カラスはここまでついて来られないのだとわかり、ふとっちょはよろこんだのです。
</J><E>
He was glad, because he knew that no crow could follow him down there.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
9 あらいぐま夫人が目をさましました。
</J><E>
Mrs. Coon waked up.
</E></T>
<T><J>
彼女は、ふとっちょの背中がいたましく切りさかれているのに目を止めました
</J><E>
She saw that Fatty's back was sadly torn
</E></T>
<T><J>
（あらいぐまというものは、みなさんもご存知でしょうが、みなさんが昼中に見るのと同じくらいに暗がりがよく見えるのです）。
</J><E>
(for coons, you know, can see in the dark just as well as you can see in the daylight).
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
10 「一体ぜんたいなにがあったんだい？」
</J><E>
"What on earth is the matter?" 
</E></T>
<T><J>
あらいぐま夫人はさけびました。
</J><E>
she exclaimed.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
11 ふとっちょはあわれっぽくわけを話しました。
</J><E>
Poor Fatty told her.
</E></T>
<T><J>
彼はちょっぴり泣きました。
</J><E>
He cried a little,
</E></T>
<T><J>
背中が痛むのと、ふたたび安全なわが家にかえることができたうれしさのためでした。 
</J><E>
because his back hurt him, and because he was so glad to be safe at home once more.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
12 「その卵はなに色だったの？」
</J><E>
"What color were those eggs?"
</E></T>
<T><J>
あらいぐま夫人がたずねました。
</J><E>
Mrs. Coon inquired.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
13 「白だよ！」
</J><E>
"White!" 
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょは答えました。
</J><E>
said Fatty.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
14 「ハハア！」
</J><E>
"Ah, ha!"
</E></T>
<T><J>
あらいぐま夫人は言いました。
</J><E>
Mrs. Coon said.
</E></T>
<T><J>
「カラスの卵は青みがかった緑色だということを忘れたのかい？　
</J><E>
"Don't you remember that crows' eggs are a blueish green?
</E></T>
<T><J>
それはオオタカの巣にちがいないよ。
</J><E>
That must have been a goshawk's nest.
</E></T>
<T><J>
オオタカはすべてのタカの中でも一番どうもうなんだよ。
</J><E>
And a goshawk is the fiercest of all the hawks there are.
</E></T>
<T><J>
背中を引っかかれてもふしぎはないよ。
</J><E>
It's no wonder your back is clawed.
</E></T>
<T><J>
こっちに来て見せてごらん」
</J><E>
Come here and let me look at it."
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
15 ふとっちょあらいぐまはすっかり誇らしくなりました。
</J><E>
Fatty Coon felt quite proud, 
</E></T>
<T><J>
お母さんが調べているのは、オオタカにむごたらしく切りさかれた傷あとなのです。
</J><E>
as his mother examined the marks of the goshawk's cruel claws.
</E></T>
<T><J>
彼は、おそらくみなさんが考えている半分も、自分をかわいそうだと思っていませんでした。
</J><E>
And he didn't feel half as sorry for himself as you might think,
</E></T>
<T><J>
卵の味がどれほどおいしかったかを思い出していたからです。
</J><E>
for he remembered how good the eggs had tasted.
</E></T>
<T><J>
彼はただ、あの卵を一ダースも食べられたらよかったのになあ、とばかり考えていました。 
</J><E>
He only wished there had been a dozen of them.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>

</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょ、かめ夫人のひみつを発見する
</J><E>
FATTY DISCOVERS MRS. TURTLE'S SECRET
</E></T>
<T><J>
1 オオタカの冒険があってから長いあいだ、ふとっちょあらいぐまは、木のてっぺんに近寄りませんでした。
</J><E>
After his adventure with the goshawk Fatty Coon did not go near the tree-tops for a long time.
</E></T>
<T><J>
自分の住んでいる家である古いポプラの木のうろから出るときは、かならず下におりました。
</J><E>
Whenever he left home he would crawl down the old poplar tree in which he lived;
</E></T>
<T><J>
家にかえるのでなければ、ただの一本の木にも登りませんでした。
</J><E>
and he wouldn't climb a single tree until he came home again.
</E></T>
<T><J>
地面の上にいれば、とにかく安心できました。
</J><E>
Somehow, he felt safer on the ground.
</E></T>
<T><J>
だって、木のてっぺんで恐ろしい思いをしたことも、オオタカのかぎづめで背中を傷つけられたことも、忘れてはいなかったのですからね。
</J><E>
You see, he hadn't forgotten the fright he had had, nor how the goshawk's claws had hurt his back.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
2 正確に言えば、恐ろしい目にあってから、ちょうど三日目のことでした。
</J><E>
It was just three days after his scare, to be exact, 
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょあらいぐまは、スウィフト川のゆるい流れにできた入江の浅瀬に、ひょっこり出くわしました。
</J><E>
when Fatty Coon found himself on the bank of the creek which flowed slowly into Swift River.
</E></T>
<T><J>
カエルをさがしていたのですが、まったくつきに恵まれていませんでした。
</J><E>
Fatty had been looking for frogs, but he had had no luck at all.
</E></T>
<T><J>
本当のことを言いますと、ふとっちょはまだ小さすぎて、カエルを見つけられたときだって、簡単につかまえることはできませんでした。
</J><E>
To tell the truth, Fatty was a little too young to catch frogs easily, even when he found one;
</E></T>
<T><J>
それに、うんと太っており、体がたいそう丸かったので、あまりすばしっこくなかったのです。
</J><E>
and he was a good deal too fat, for he was so plump that he was not very spry.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
3 入江に出くわしたふとっちょは、背の高いイグサの草むらのかげに隠れ、するどいつぶらな目で辺りをぐるりと見まわしました。
</J><E>
Now, Fatty was hiding behind some tall rushes, and his sharp little eyes were looking all about him, 
</E></T>
<T><J>
鼻をひくつかせ、空気のにおいをかぎました。
</J><E>
and his nose was twitching as he sniffed the air.
</E></T>
<T><J>
カエルはいないかしらと思いました。
</J><E>
He wished he might find a frog.
</E></T>
<T><J>
けれど、一ぴきの姿も見あたりませんでした。
</J><E>
But not one frog appeared.
</E></T>
<T><J>
ほかのあらいぐまが、ふとっちょが来るちょっと前にやって来て、ここのカエルを全部とってしまったにちがいない、と、ふとっちょは考えはじめました。
</J><E>
Fatty began to think that some other coon must have visited the creek just before him and caught them all.
</E></T>
<T><J>
つづいて、ふとっちょはカエルのことをすっかり忘れてしまいました。
</J><E>
And then he forgot all about frogs.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
4 そうですとも！　
</J><E>
Yes!
</E></T>
<T><J>
カエルのことなど、ふとっちょあらいぐまは、頭からすっかり追い出してしまいました。
</J><E>
Frogs passed completely out of Fatty Coon's mind. 
</E></T>
<T><J>
そんなものより、もっと興味深いものに目を注いでいたのです。
</J><E>
For whom should he spy 
</E></T>
<T><J>
かめ夫人です！　
</J><E>
but Mrs. Turtle!
</E></T>
<T><J>
最初にふとっちょが見つけたのは、かめ夫人の小さな黒い頭でした。
</J><E>
He saw her little black head first, 
</E></T>
<T><J>
それは、入江の岸にそって、ぷかぷかと流れていました。
</J><E>
bobbing along through the water of the creek.
</E></T>
<T><J>
かめ夫人は、ふとっちょが隠れている岸辺にむかって、泳いできました。
</J><E>
She was swimming toward the bank where Fatty was hidden.
</E></T>
<T><J>
泳ぎつくと、かめ夫人はすぐさま水から上がり、入江のほとりの砂の上を、よちよち歩き出しました。
</J><E>
And pretty soon she pulled herself out of the water and waddled a short distance along the sand at the edge of the creek.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
5 かめ夫人は、少し歩いたところで、立ち止まりました。
</J><E>
Mrs. Turtle stopped then; 
</E></T>
<T><J>
そして少しのあいだ、とても忙しそうになにかをしました。
</J><E>
and for a few minutes she was very busy about something.
</E></T>
<T><J>
最初、彼女は砂に穴をほりました。
</J><E>
First she dug a hole in the sand.
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょは、彼女はなにをさがしているのかしら、と思いました。
</J><E>
And Fatty wondered what she was looking for.
</E></T>
<T><J>
でも、ふとっちょはじっと静かに隠れつづけました。
</J><E>
But he kept very quiet.
</E></T>
<T><J>
しばらくすると、かめ夫人はまた入江の水にざぶんと入り、泳いで去っていきました。
</J><E>
And after a time Mrs. Turtle splashed into the creek again and paddled away.
</E></T>
<T><J>
けれど、彼女は立ち去る前に、ほった穴に砂をかけていきました。
</J><E>
But before she left she scooped sand into the hole she had dug. 
</E></T>
<T><J>
それから、辺りをぐるりと見まわしました。
</J><E>
Before she left the place she looked all around, 
</E></T>
<T><J>
まるで、だれか彼女を見ていた者はいないかと、確かめるように。
</J><E>
as if to make sure that no one had seen her.
</E></T>
<T><J>
それから、川にむかってよちよちとゆっくり歩いていくとき、ふとっちょは、彼女がほほ笑んでいるのを見ました。
</J><E>
And as she waddled slowly to the water Fatty could see that she was smiling 
</E></T>
<T><J>
まるで、大いに満足しているというように。
</J><E>
as if she was very well pleased about something.
</E></T>
<T><J>
かめ夫人は、ひみつを隠しているように見えました。
</J><E>
She seemed to have a secret.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
6 かめ夫人をぬすみ見ているうちに、ふとっちょあらいぐまは、ひどく興味をかき立てられました。
</J><E>
Fatty Coon had grown very curious, as he watched Mrs. Turtle.
</E></T>
<T><J>
彼女の姿が見えなくなると、ふとっちょはすぐさま隠れていた背の高いイグサの草むらからとび出し、小走りで入江のほとりに下りていきました。
</J><E>
And just as soon as she was out of sight he came out from his hiding place in the tall reeds and trotted down to the edge of the creek.
</E></T>
<T><J>
かめ夫人が穴をほり、また埋めもどした場所に、まっすぐに向かいました。
</J><E>
He went straight to the spot where Mrs. Turtle had dug the hole and filled it up again.
</E></T>
<T><J>
彼女がしたことがなんだったのか、知りたくてたまりませんでした。
</J><E>
And Fatty was so eager to know what she had been doing 
</E></T>
<T><J>
足元のかめ夫人がほった場所を、ほり返しはじめました。
</J><E>
that he began to dig in the very spot where Mrs. Turtle had dug before him.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
7 ほんの六つ数えるうちに、ふとっちょあらいぐまは、かめ夫人のひみつを発見しました。
</J><E>
It took Fatty Coon only about six seconds to discover Mrs. Turtle's secret.
</E></T>
<T><J>
そこは深い砂でできた川岸だったので、前足のかぎづめを使わなくても、かんたんにほれました。
</J><E>
For he did not have to paw away much of the sand
</E></T>
<T><J>
目の前にあらわれたのは
</J><E>
before he came upon
</E></T>
<T><J>
――なんだと思いますか？
</J><E>
--what do you suppose?
</E></T>
<T><J>
卵です！　
</J><E>
Eggs!
</E></T>
<T><J>
かめの卵です！　
</J><E>
Turtles' eggs!
</E></T>
<T><J>
二十七個の、丸くて白い卵です。
</J><E>
Twenty-seven round, white eggs,
</E></T>
<T><J>
かめ夫人は、卵をかえすために、あたたかい砂の中に埋めておいたのです。
</J><E>
which Mrs. Turtle had left there in the warm sand to hatch.
</E></T>
<T><J>
それこそが、彼女がだれも見ていないかと、辺りをぐるりと確かめたわけだったのです。
</J><E>
THAT was why she looked all around to make sure that no one saw her.
</E></T>
<T><J>
それこそが、とても満足そうだったわけなのです。
</J><E>
THAT was why she seemed so pleased. 
</E></T>
<T><J>
かめ夫人は、期待で胸をふくらませていたのです。
</J><E>
For Mrs. Turtle fully expected 
</E></T>
<T><J>
しばらくしたら、これらの卵から二十七ひきの子がめがかえるのだと思って
</J><E>
that after a time twenty-seven little turtles would hatch from those eggs
</E></T>
<T><J>
――ちょうどニワトリのようにね
</J><E>
--just as chickens do
</E></T>
<T><J>
――そして、自分で砂をかき分けて、穴の中から出てくるでしょう。
</J><E>
--and dig their way out of the sand.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
8 けれど、決してそうはなりませんでした。
</J><E>
But it never happened that way at all.
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょあらいぐまは、卵を見つけたおどろきからさめるやいなや、ただちに二十七個の卵にぱくつきはじめました。
</J><E>
For as soon as he got over his surprise at seeing them, Fatty Coon began at once to eat those twenty- seven eggs.
</E></T>
<T><J>
おいしい卵でした。
</J><E>
They were delicious.
</E></T>
<T><J>
最後のひとつを食べおわるころには、なんて幸運だったんだろうと思わずにはいられませんでした。
</J><E>
And as he finished the last one he couldn't help thinking how lucky he had been.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょあらいぐまのしくじり
</J><E>
IV
FATTY COON'S MISTAKE
</E></T>
<T><J>
1 ふとっちょあらいぐまは、リスが大好きでした。
</J><E>
Fatty Coon was very fond of squirrels.
</E></T>
<T><J>
そして、こんなふうにお話すると、おかしいと思うでしょう。
</J><E>
And you may think it strange when I tell you
</E></T>
<T><J>
ブルー山に住んでいるリスたちの中で、ふとっちょあらいぐまをほんの少しでも好いている者は、一ぴきもいませんでした、なんて。
</J><E>
that not one of the squirrels anywhere around Blue Mountain was the least bit fond of Fatty Coon.
</E></T>
<T><J>
しかし、ふとっちょあらいぐまがリスが好きだというときは、食べるのが好きだという意味なのです。
</J><E>
But when I say that Fatty Coon was fond of squirrels, I mean that he liked to eat them.
</E></T>
<T><J>
ですから、リスたちがふとっちょのことを嫌っているわけは、もちろん、もうおわかりでしょう。
</J><E>
So of course you will understand now why the squirrels did not care for Fatty at all.
</E></T>
<T><J>
実際のところ、リスたちはいつも、ふとっちょからできるだけ遠ざかっているようにしていました。
</J><E>
In fact, they usually kept just as far away from him as they could.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
2 昼中ならば、木のてっぺんからてっぺんへとうろつき回るふとっちょを避けているのは、リスたちには簡単でした。
</J><E>
It was easy, in the daytime, for the squirrels to keep out of Fatty's way, when he wandered through the tree-tops, 
</E></T>
<T><J>
リスたちは、ふとっちょよりもずっとよく、相手を見つけ出すことができました。
</J><E>
for the squirrels were much sprier than Fatty.
</E></T>
<T><J>
けれど、夜は
</J><E>
But at night
</E></T>
<T><J>
――ああ！　
</J><E>
--ah! 
</E></T>
<T><J>
事情がずいぶんちがうのです。
</J><E>
that was a very different matter.
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょあらいぐまの目は、昼中のリスたちよりも、夜の暗やみのほうが、いっそうするどいのです。
</J><E>
For Fatty Coon's eyes were even sharper in the dark than they were in the daylight;
</E></T>
<T><J>
しかし、哀れなリスたちは、みなさんが寝室の明かりを消し、ベッドの毛布に安全にくるまっているときと同じくらい、なんにも見えないのです。
</J><E>
but the poor squirrels were just as blind as you are when you are safely tucked in bed and the light is put out.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
3 そうなのです
</J><E>
Yes
</E></T>
<T><J>
――夜になると、リスたちは、木の上の巣穴の寝どこに入ります。
</J><E>
--when the squirrels were in bed at night, up in their nests in the trees, 
</E></T>
<T><J>
彼らはほんの少ししか、見ることができません。
</J><E>
they could see very little.
</E></T>
<T><J>
そして、彼らが寝どこの中にいるときは、安全とは言えません。
</J><E>
And you couldn't say they were SAFE in bed,
</E></T>
<T><J>
なぜなら、ふとっちょあらいぐまがリスをつかまえにやって来ても、彼らには決してわからないからです。
</J><E>
because they never knew when Fatty Coon,
</E></T>
<T><J>
または、ふとっちょのお母さんや、弟や、妹のどちらかか、あるいはふとっちょのいとこがやって来ても、つかまえられる前にそうと知ることができないのです。
</J><E>
or his mother, or his brother, or one of his sisters, or some cousin of his, might come along and catch them before they knew it. 
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
4 ふとっちょは、夜のリス狩りを、とても楽しい気晴らしと考えていました。
</J><E>
Fatty thought it great sport to hunt squirrels at night.
</E></T>
<T><J>
リス狩りをすれば、いつでもつねに、おいしい肉を手に入れることができました。
</J><E>
Whenever he tried it he usually managed to get a good meal. 
</E></T>
<T><J>
ヘムロックの大木でオオタカにおそわれた恐ろしさを、おおかた忘れかけてからは、彼はリスや眠っている鳥をさがして、毎晩のように木のてっぺんをうろつき回るようになりました。
</J><E>
And after he had almost forgotten about the fright the goshawk had given him in the tall hemlock he began to roam through the tree-tops every night in search of squirrels and sleeping birds.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
5 しかし昨日の晩は、リス狩りをしていて、こりごりする目にあいました。
</J><E>
But a night came at last when Fatty was well punished for hunting squirrels.
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょは、大きなクリの木を半分ほど登ったところで、幹に空いた穴をのぞき込みました。
</J><E>
He had climbed half-way to the top of a big chestnut tree, when he spied a hole in the trunk.
</E></T>
<T><J>
その穴の中に、リスが住んでいるにちがいないと思い込んだのです。
</J><E>
He rather thought that some squirrels lived inside that hole.
</E></T>
<T><J>
しばらく耳をすませていると、中でなにかが動く物音が聞こえました。
</J><E>
And as he listened for a few seconds he could hear something moving about inside.
</E></T>
<T><J>
しめしめ！　
</J><E>
Yes!
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょは、中にリスがいると確信しました
</J><E>
Fatty was sure that there was a squirrel in there
</E></T>
<T><J>
――数ひきのリスがいるのだろうと。
</J><E>
--probably several squirrels.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
6 ふとっちょあらいぐまの目が、緑色に変わりました。
</J><E>
Fatty Coon's eyes turned green.
</E></T>
<T><J>
それがあらいぐまのくせなのです。
</J><E>
It was a way they had,
</E></T>
<T><J>
食べるときや、弟の黒っちょや妹のふわりっちょやかわいっちょと遊ぶとき、おびえているときなど、どんなときでも、こうなるのです。
</J><E>
whenever he was about to eat anything, or whenever he played with his brother Blackie, or Fluffy and Cutey, his sisters; or whenever he was frightened.
</E></T>
<T><J>
今は、おいしいおやつを食べられるのだと確信したので、ネコみたいに目が緑色に変わったのです。
</J><E>
And now Fatty was so sure that he was going to have a fine lunch that his eyes turned as green as a cat's.
</E></T>
<T><J>
彼は前足を穴の中に入れ、中をさぐり回りました。
</J><E>
He reached a paw inside the hole and felt all around.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
7 ウワア！　
</J><E>
WOW!
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょはさけび声を上げました。
</J><E>
Fatty gave a cry;
</E></T>
<T><J>
前足を、入れたときよりもはるかにはやく、出しました。
</J><E>
and he pulled his paw out much faster than he had put it in.
</E></T>
<T><J>
なにかが、彼の手をひどく強く突きとばしたのです。
</J><E>
Something had given him a cruel dig.
</E></T>
<T><J>
爐覆砲瓩呂垢阿砲錣りました。
</J><E>
And in a jiffy Fatty saw what that "something" was.
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょがこれまで見かけたことのない、気むずかしそうな顔をした、年老いた浮浪あらいぐまでした。
</J><E>
It was a grumpy old tramp coon, whom Fatty had never seen before.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
8 「どういうつもりだ、いたずらっ子め。
</J><E>
"What do you mean, you young rascal,
</E></T>
<T><J>
こんなふうに休んでいるところを邪魔するのは？」
</J><E>
by disturbing me like this?" 
</E></T>
<T><J>
みすぼらしいよそ者が、さけびました。
</J><E>
the ragged stranger cried.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
9 「ごめんなさい。
</J><E>
"Please, sir,
</E></T>
<T><J>
あなただとは思いもしなかったんです」
</J><E>
I never knew it was you,"
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょは、口ごもりながら言いました。
</J><E>
Fatty stammered.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
10 「思いもしなかっただと！　
</J><E>
"Never knew it was me!
</E></T>
<T><J>
だれだと思ったんだ？」
</J><E>
Who did you think it was?"
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
11 「リ……リスだと思って！」
</J><E>
"A--a squirrel!" 
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょは、消え入りそうな声で言いました。
</J><E>
Fatty said faintly.
</E></T>
<T><J>
彼はちょっぴりべそをかきました。
</J><E>
And he whimpered a little,
</E></T>
<T><J>
前足で、浮浪あらいぐまを引っかいてしまったからです。
</J><E>
because his paw hurt him.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
12 「ほ、ほう！　
</J><E>
"Ho, ho!
</E></T>
<T><J>
そりゃあいい！　
</J><E>
That's a good one! 
</E></T>
<T><J>
おもしろい冗談だ！」
</J><E>
That's a good joke!"
</E></T>
<T><J>
浮浪あらいぐまは、心の底からおかしそうに笑い声を立てました。
</J><E>
The tramp coon laughed heartily.
</E></T>
<T><J>
それから、恐ろしい顔でふとっちょをにらみつけたので、ふとっちょはあやうく木から転がり落ちそうになりました。
</J><E>
And then he scowled so fiercely that poor Fatty nearly tumbled out of the tree.
</E></T>
<T><J>
「家へ帰れ」
</J><E>
"You go home,"
</E></T>
<T><J>
浮浪あらいぐまは、ふとっちょに言いました。
</J><E>
he said to Fatty.
</E></T>
<T><J>
「今度ここに来たら、ただじゃおかんぞ。
</J><E>
"And don't you let me catch you around here again.
</E></T>
<T><J>
聞こえたか？」
</J><E>
You hear?"
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
13 「はい、わかりました！」
</J><E>
"Yes, sir!"
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょは言いました。
</J><E>
Fatty said.
</E></T>
<T><J>
そして、家に帰りました。
</J><E>
And home he went.
</E></T>
<T><J>
その後、ふとっちょがその木をそうっとしておいたことを、みなさんも疑わないでしょう。
</J><E>
And you may be sure that he let THAT tree alone after that. 
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょは、二度とその木に近づきませんでした。
</J><E>
He never went near it again.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょあらいぐまと魚つり

V
FATTY COON GOES FISHING
</E></T>
<T><J>
1 ある日、ふとっちょあらいぐまは、家からそれほど遠くないところを流れる小川をうろついていました。
</J><E>
One day Fatty Coon was strolling along the brook which flowed not far from his home.
</E></T>
<T><J>
水辺のふちで、あっちこっちで立ち止まっては、うずくまりました。
</J><E>
He stopped now and then, to crouch close to the water's edge,
</E></T>
<T><J>
魚は取れないかと思っていたのです。
</J><E>
in the hope of catching a fish.
</E></T>
<T><J>
あるとき彼は、小川の深いよどみのほとりの岩のあいだに横たわり、静かにじっとしていました。
</J><E>
And one time, when he lay quite still among the rocks, at the side of a deep pool,
</E></T>
<T><J>
目は、すきとおった水の中をさぐっていました。
</J><E>
with his eyes searching the clear water,
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふいに、なにやら光るものを見つけました。
</J><E>
Fatty Coon suddenly saw something bright, 
</E></T>
<T><J>
全身が黄色と赤色をしたものが、ふとっちょあらいぐまの右手前方の水の上で、ぴかぴか光っていました。
</J><E>
all yellow and red, that lighted on the water right before him.
</E></T>
<T><J>
カブトムシだ。
</J><E>
It was a bug,
</E></T>
<T><J>
それか、大きなハエだ。
</J><E>
or a huge fly.
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょは、カブトムシが大好きでした
</J><E>
And Fatty was very fond of bugs
</E></T>
<T><J>
――食べるのが、ね。
</J><E>
--to eat, you know.
</E></T>
<T><J>
ですから、ぐずぐずしませんでした。
</J><E>
So he lost no time.
</E></T>
<T><J>
その光るものは、水の上でちょこちょこ動きまわり、少しもじっとしていませんでした。
</J><E>
The bright thing had scarcely settled on the water 
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょは、すきを見て前足を伸ばし、それをつかみ取りました。
</J><E>
when Fatty reached out and seized it.
</E></T>
<T><J>
それを口の中にほうり込むと、たいそうおかしなことが起こりました。
</J><E>
He put it into his mouth, when the strangest thing happened.
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょの体が右側にぐいと引っぱられ、水の中に引きずり込まれたのです。
</J><E>
Fatty felt himself pulled right over into the water.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
2 ふとっちょはおどろきました。
</J><E>
He was surprised, 
</E></T>
<T><J>
カブトムシやハエの力がこれほど強いとは、聞いたこともありませんでしたから。
</J><E>
for he never knew a bug or a fly to be so strong as that.
</E></T>
<T><J>
なにかがふとっちょのほっぺたをちくりと刺しました。
</J><E>
Something pricked his cheek 
</E></T>
<T><J>
彼は、光るものが刺したのだと思いました。
</J><E>
and Fatty thought that the bright thing had stung him.
</E></T>
<T><J>
光るものを口から出そうとして、またおどろきました。
</J><E>
He tried to take it out of his mouth, and he was surprised again.
</E></T>
<T><J>
光るものは、彼の口の中にしっかりと突きささり、なにがなんでも離れないようでした。
</J><E>
Whatever the thing was, it seemed to be stuck fast in his mouth.
</E></T>
<T><J>
そのあいだ、ふとっちょは、水の中を引きずられ続けていました。
</J><E>
And all the time Fatty was being dragged along through the water.
</E></T>
<T><J>
彼は、恐くなってきました。
</J><E>
He began to be frightened.
</E></T>
<T><J>
最初に気づいたのは、細い糸でした。
</J><E>
And for the first time he noticed that there was a slender line
</E></T>
<T><J>
それは、彼の口から伸びて、小川のよどみの向こうへとまっすぐに続いていました。
</J><E>
which stretched from his mouth straight across the pool.
</E></T>
<T><J>
糸をずっとたどっていきますと、糸のとぎれれた先に、人間がいるのが見えました
</J><E>
As he looked along the line Fatty saw a man at the other end of it
</E></T>
<T><J>
――人間が、小川の反対岸に立っていました！　
</J><E>
--a man, standing on the other side of the brook! 
</E></T>
<T><J>
人間は、できるかぎりのはやさで糸をたぐり、ふとっちょを自分のほうに引きよせていました。
</J><E>
And he was pulling Fatty toward him as fast as he could.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
3 みなさんは、ふとっちょあらいぐまが、ただおびえていただけだったと思いますか？　
</J><E>
Do you wonder that Fatty Coon was frightened?
</E></T>
<T><J>
彼は、後ろに飛びすざりました
</J><E>
He jumped back
</E></T>
<T><J>
――水の中で、できるかぎりそうしました
</J><E>
--as well as he could, in the water
</E></T>
<T><J>
――そして、泳いで逃げようとしました。
</J><E>
--and tried to swim away.
</E></T>
<T><J>
口の中をけがしました。
</J><E>
His mouth hurt;
</E></T>
<T><J>
それでもひるまずに、変わらない強さで、水の中にもぐったり、後ろに引いたりしました。
</J><E>
but he plunged and pulled just the same, 
</E></T>
<T><J>
頭をぐいぐい引っぱったり、もがいたり、身をよじったり、のたうったりしました。
</J><E>
and jerked his head and squirmed and wriggled and twisted.
</E></T>
<T><J>
もう逃げられないと、ほとんどあきらめかけた、まさにそのとき、派手な色のカブトムシだか、ハエだか、とにかくなんだかが、ふとっちょの口の中から飛び出しました。
</J><E>
And just as Fatty had almost given up hope of getting free, the gay-colored bug, or fly, or whatever it was, flew out of his mouth 
</E></T>
<T><J>
それと一緒に、糸もどこかに飛んでいきました。
</J><E>
and took the line with it.
</E></T>
<T><J>
少なくとも、ふとっちょあらいぐまはそう思いました。
</J><E>
At least, that was what Fatty Coon thought.
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょは急いで川岸まで泳ぎ、やぶの中に逃げ込みました。
</J><E>
And he swam quickly to the bank and scampered into the bushes.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
4 さて、これは本当に起こったできごとでした。
</J><E>
Now, this was what really happened.
</E></T>
<T><J>
農夫のグリーンは、マスを取りに小川にやって来ました。
</J><E>
Farmer Green had come up the brook to catch trout.
</E></T>
<T><J>
グリーンは、つり糸の先に、ぎじ餌を結んでおきました。
</J><E>
On the end of his fish-line he had tied a make-believe fly,
</E></T>
<T><J>
赤と黄色の羽根のうら側に、つり針が隠されているものです。
</J><E>
with a hook hidden under its red and yellow wings. 
</E></T>
<T><J>
彼は、小川の流れにそって、とても静かにぎじ餌を動かしました。
</J><E>
He had stolen along the brook very quietly, 
</E></T>
<T><J>
魚をおどろかせないためです。
</J><E>
so that he wouldn't frighten the fish.
</E></T>
<T><J>
とても少ししか物音を立てなかったので、ふとっちょあらいぐまは、グリーンにまったく気づきませんでした。
</J><E>
And he had made so little noise that Fatty Coon never heard him at all.
</E></T>
<T><J>
農夫のグリーンには、ふとっちょの姿が見えませんでした。
</J><E>
Farmer Green had not seen Fatty, 
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょは、岩のあいだでかがんでいましたから。
</J><E>
crouched as he was among the stones.
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょがぎじ餌に手を伸ばしてつかみ取ったとき、農夫のグリーンは、ふとっちょ自身よりもなおいっそう、このできごとにおどろきました。
</J><E>
And when Fatty reached out and grabbed the make-believe fly Farmer Green was even more surprised at what happened than Fatty himself.
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょの口からつり針が外れなければ、農夫のグリーンはもうちょっとで、これまでだれ一人つったことのないような、奇妙な魚をつり上げるところでした。
</J><E>
If the fish-hook hadn't worked loose from Fatty's mouth Farmer Green would have caught the queerest fish anybody ever caught, almost.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
5 農夫のグリーンは、ふとっちょがやぶの中に逃げ込むのをながめながら、ひどくおもしろがっているようでした。
</J><E>
Something seemed to amuse Farmer Green, as he watched Fatty dive into the bushes;
</E></T>
<T><J>
彼は、長いこと大声でげらげら笑っていました。
</J><E>
and he laughed loud and long.
</E></T>
<T><J>
でも、ふとっちょあらいぐまは、ちっとも笑いませんでした。
</J><E>
But Fatty Coon didn't laugh at all.
</E></T>
<T><J>
口の中があまりにもひどく痛んでいたし、ひどくおびえてもいたのです。
</J><E>
His mouth was too sore; and he was too frightened.
</E></T>
<T><J>
でも、とてもとても、よろこんでもいました。
</J><E>
But he was very, very glad 
</E></T>
<T><J>
おかしなカブトムシが、どこかに飛んでいってくれたのですから。
</J><E>
that the strange bug had flown away.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>

VI
FATTY AND THE GREEN CORN
</E></T>
<T><J>
1 その夏のさかり、ふとっちょあらいぐまは、一生のうちでいちばん素晴らしい時をすごしていると信じていました。
</J><E>
It was mid-summer when Fatty Coon had what he then believed to be the finest time in all his life.
</E></T>
<T><J>
のちになり、年寄りになってもまだ、そう思っていました。
</J><E>
And later, when he was older, he still thought
</E></T>
<T><J>
彼が幼いあらいぐまだったとき、お母さんがびっくりするところに連れていってくれたときのような楽しい出来事は、二度となかったのです。
</J><E>
that nothing had ever happened to him that was quite so enjoyable as that surprise his mother gave him when he was a young coon.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
2 もちろん、食べるところですよ
</J><E>
Of course it was something to eat
</E></T>
<T><J>
――びっくりするところというのは。
</J><E>
--the surprise.
</E></T>
<T><J>
みなさんは、ふとっちょあらいぐまのことはもうご存知ですから、きっとそうだろうとお思いになったでしょう。
</J><E>
You must have guessed that, knowing Fatty Coon as you do.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
3 「おいで、子どもたち！」
</J><E>
"Come, children!" 
</E></T>
<T><J>
あらいぐま夫人が言いました。
</J><E>
Mrs. Coon said.
</E></T>
<T><J>
「わたしについておいで！　
</J><E>
"Come with me!
</E></T>
<T><J>
びっくりするようないいところに連れてったげるよ
</J><E>
I'm going to give you a treat
</E></T>
<T><J>
――とっておきのすてきなところだよ」
</J><E>
--something specially nice."
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
4 「食べにいくの？」
</J><E>
"Is it something to eat?"
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょがたずねました。
</J><E>
Fatty asked,
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょたちは、農夫のグリーンの農場にむかって歩いていました。
</J><E>
as they started off in the direction of Farmer Green's fields.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
5 「そうよ
</J><E>
"Yes
</E></T>
<T><J>
――お前がこれまで食べた中で、いちばんおいしいごちそうだよ」
</J><E>
--and the best thing you ever tasted," 
</E></T>
<T><J>
あらいぐま夫人が言いました。
</J><E>
Mrs. Coon said.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
6 ふとっちょは大いに興奮しました。
</J><E>
Fatty was greatly excited.
</E></T>
<T><J>
月明かりの下で、彼のつぶらなかがやく目が、緑色に変わりました。
</J><E>
His little bright eyes turned green in the moonlight.
</E></T>
<T><J>
どんなびっくりするごちそうがあるのかしらと思いました。
</J><E>
He wondered what the surprise would be. 
</E></T>
<T><J>
いつものことですが、彼は腹ぺこでした。
</J><E>
And, as usual, he was very hungry.
</E></T>
<T><J>
彼は、お母さんにぴったりくっついて歩きました。
</J><E>
He walked close beside his mother,
</E></T>
<T><J>
びっくりするようなごちそうを、まっさきに味見したかったからです。
</J><E>
for he wanted to be the first to taste the surprise.
</E></T>
<T><J>
みなさんは、ふとっちょが二人の妹に最初に味見させてあげると思うでしょう。
</J><E>
You would think that he would have wanted his two sisters to taste it first,
</E></T>
<T><J>
それに、弟の黒っちょにも。
</J><E>
and his brother Blackie, too.
</E></T>
<T><J>
しかし、ふとっちょは食いしんぼうだということを忘れてはなりません。
</J><E>
But you must not forget that Fatty was greedy.
</E></T>
<T><J>
食いしんぼうというのは、ほかの人を思いやったりしないものなのです。
</J><E>
And greedy people are not thoughtful of others.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
7 あらいぐま夫人は、小道をわきに反れ、柵の下を腹ばいになってくぐり抜けました。
</J><E>
When Mrs. Coon turned out of the lane and crawled through the fence, 
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょは、横木のすきまを無理やり通り抜けました。
</J><E>
Fatty squeezed between the rails 
</E></T>
<T><J>
彼にしては、とても素早い身のこなしでした。
</J><E>
very nimbly, for him.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
8 「ここだよ！」
</J><E>
"Here we are!" 
</E></T>
<T><J>
お母さんが言いました。
</J><E>
said his mother.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
9 ふとっちょは辺りを見まわしました。
</J><E>
Fatty looked about him.
</E></T>
<T><J>
そこは、背の高い茎の植物が空高く生いしげった畑の中でした。
</J><E>
They stood in a field grown high with tall stalks of some sort,
</E></T>
<T><J>
茎の植物は青あおと色づき、リボンのような形の葉っぱは、根もとから半分だけ空にむいて立ちあがり、先っぽはひらひらと垂れ下がっていました。
</J><E>
which turned to green, ribbon-like leaves half way up from the ground.
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょは、不満にうめき声をあげました。
</J><E>
Fatty grunted.
</E></T>
<T><J>
とてもおぎょうぎが悪いですよね。
</J><E>
He was very impolite, you see.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
10 「ねえ
</J><E>
"Well
</E></T>
<T><J>
――おいしい食べ物ってなんなのさ？」
</J><E>
--what is there to eat that's so fine?"
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょは言いました。
</J><E>
he asked.
</E></T>
<T><J>
「こんなのおいしくないじゃないか。
</J><E>
"This stuff isn't good.
</E></T>
<T><J>
アシみたいな味がするよ」
</J><E>
It's like eating reeds." 
</E></T>
<T><J>
彼は、すでに茎の一本をかじっていました。
</J><E>
He had already bitten into one of the stalks.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
11 「あれはなんと呼ぶの？」
</J><E>
"What do you call that?" 
</E></T>
<T><J>
あらいぐま夫人がたずねました。
</J><E>
Mrs. Coon asked.
</E></T>
<T><J>
彼女は、茎の一本から伸びている、緑色の皮で巻かれた長いものを、ふとっちょに指ししめしました。
</J><E>
She showed Fatty a long roll of green that grew out of one of the stalks.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
12 「ガマの穂みたいなやつさ」
</J><E>
"That's something like a cattail,"
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょが言いました。
</J><E>
said Fatty.
</E></T>
<T><J>
「食べたっておいしくないよ」
</J><E>
"It isn't good to eat."
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
13 「食べてみたことがあるのかい？」
</J><E>
"Have you ever tried one?" 
</E></T>
<T><J>
お母さんがたずねました。
</J><E>
asked his mother.
</E></T>
<T><J>
14 「ううん」
</J><E>
"N--no,"
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょは言いました。
</J><E>
Patty said.
</E></T>
<T><J>
「でも、アオカケスのフレディがおいしくないって言ったよ」
</J><E>
"But Freddie Bluejay told me they weren't good."
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
15 「フレディがそう言ったの？」
</J><E>
"He did, did he?"
</E></T>
<T><J>
あらいぐま夫人は、それ以上なにも言いませんでした。
</J><E>
Mrs. Coon said nothing more.
</E></T>
<T><J>
彼女は後足で立ちあがると、背の高い茎の一本を、下に引っぱりました。
</J><E>
She stood up on her hind legs and pulled one of the tall stalks down
</E></T>
<T><J>
そして、茎から伸びている緑色の皮に巻かれた長いものを、前足でつかみました。
</J><E>
until she could reach that long, green thing that grew there. 
</E></T>
<T><J>
次の瞬間、彼女は茎から緑色の長いものをもぎ取りました。
</J><E>
In a jiffy she had torn it from its stalk.
</E></T>
<T><J>
それから、長いものから緑色の皮をはぎ取りました。
</J><E>
And then she stripped the green covering off it.
</E></T>
<T><J>
「かじってごらん！」
</J><E>
"Try that!"
</E></T>
<T><J>
あらいぐま夫人は、にっこり笑って言いました。
</J><E>
said Mrs. Coon with a smile.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
16 もちろん、ふとっちょがまっさきに味見しました。
</J><E>
Of course it was Fatty who tasted it first.
</E></T>
<T><J>
彼は、白い粒つぶを口いっぱいにほおばりました。
</J><E>
He took a good mouthful of the white kernels, 
</E></T>
<T><J>
そして、大喜びしました。
</J><E>
and he was overjoyed. 
</E></T>
<T><J>
なんて甘いんだろう！　
</J><E>
Such sweetness!
</E></T>
<T><J>
このまったりとした汁のおいしさはどうだろう！　
</J><E>
Such delicious, milky juice!
</E></T>
<T><J>
この瞬間のことを、ふとっちょは生涯忘れませんでした。
</J><E>
It was a moment that Fatty never forgot.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
17 ふとっちょは、自分で茎からもぎ取り始めました。
</J><E>
Fatty began tearing down the stalks for himself
</E></T>
<T><J>
そして、ひと息つくためにとうとう食べるのを止めるまで、ひと言もしゃべりませんでした。
</J><E>
and he never said another word until at last he simply had to stop eating just to catch his breath.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
18 「これはなんという名前なの、お母さん？」
</J><E>
"What's its name, Mother?"
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょがたずねました。
</J><E>
he inquired.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
19 「とうもろこしと言うんだよ、ぼうや」
</J><E>
"Corn, my child."
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
20 「アオカケスのフレディは、どうしてこれが嫌いなんだろう？」
</J><E>
"Well, why doesn't Freddie Bluejay like it?" 
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょが言いました。
</J><E>
Fatty asked.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
21 「たぶん大好きなのさ」
</J><E>
"He's probably very fond of corn," 
</E></T>
<T><J>
あらいぐま夫人は言いました。
</J><E>
said Mrs. Coon.
</E></T>
<T><J>
「心配だったんだよ。
</J><E>
"And I've no doubt he was afraid
</E></T>
<T><J>
お前がこれを食べ始めたら、畑を全部食べつくしちまうんじゃないかってね」
</J><E>
that you would eat up this whole field, once you started."
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
22 「そうしたいなあ」
</J><E>
"I'd like to,"
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょは、ため息まじりに言いました。
</J><E>
said Fatty, with a sigh.
</E></T>
<T><J>
「世界中のとうもろこしを全部食べちゃいたいよ」
</J><E>
"I'd like to eat all the corn in the world."
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
ジョニー・グリーン、がっかりする
</J><E>
VII
JOHNNIE GREEN IS DISAPPOINTED
</E></T>
<T><J>
1 ふとっちょあらいぐまは、畑いっぱいのとうもろこしのことを考えると、悲しくなってしまいました。
</J><E>
It made Fatty Coon feel sad, just to think that there was that field full of corn,
</E></T>
<T><J>
全部食べつくすなんて、絶対にできっこないのですもの。
</J><E>
and that he could never eat all of it.
</E></T>
<T><J>
でも、ふとっちょは決心しました。
</J><E>
But Fatty made up his mind
</E></T>
<T><J>
できるかぎりのことをしてやろうと。
</J><E>
that he would do the best he could.
</E></T>
<T><J>
毎晩のようにとうもろこし畑をおとずれ、甘くて柔らかいとうもろこしの粒を満喫してやろうと。
</J><E>
He would visit the cornfield every night and feast on those sweet, tender kernels.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
2 次の日、夜になると、ふとっちょはさっそく農夫のグリーンの畑に出発しました。
</J><E>
The very next night Fatty set out toward Farmer Green's.
</E></T>
<T><J>
とても暗いとは言えない夜でした。
</J><E>
It was hardly dark.
</E></T>
<T><J>
でも、暗い夜がおとずれるまでなんて、待っていられませんでした。
</J><E>
But Fatty could not wait any longer.
</E></T>
<T><J>
お母さんや妹たちや弟が出かけるのを待っていることすら、できませんでした。
</J><E>
He could not even wait for his mother and his sisters and his brother.
</E></T>
<T><J>
彼は、ひとりで先を急ぎました。
</J><E>
He hurried away alone.
</E></T>
<T><J>
とうもろこし畑が見えてくると、ほっとしました。
</J><E>
And when he came in sight of the cornfield he felt better.
</E></T>
<T><J>
とうもろこしがなくなってしまうのではないかと、心配でしかたがなかったのです。
</J><E>
He had been the least bit afraid that the corn might be gone.
</E></T>
<T><J>
農夫のグリーンがつみ取ってしまうか、森の住民たちが全部たいらげてしまうかもしれないと、思っていたのです。
</J><E>
He thought that maybe Farmer Green had picked it, or that some of the forest people had eaten it all.
</E></T>
<T><J>
でも、ちゃんとありました
</J><E>
But there it was
</E></T>
<T><J>
――とうもろこしの森が、月光の下でそよ風に吹かれて、波うち、カサカサと音を立てていました。
</J><E>
--a forest of corn, waving and rustling in the moonlight as the breeze touched it.
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょは大よろこびしながら、柵の横木をすり抜けました。
</J><E>
Fatty felt very happy as he slipped through the rail-fence.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
3 その晩、ふとっちょはとうもろこしの実を、おそらくいくらも食べはしなかったでしょう。
</J><E>
I wouldn't dare say how many ears of corn Fatty ate that night. 
</E></T>
<T><J>
それに、あるたった一つのものがなければ、もっとたくさん食べられた、とも言えなかったでしょう。
</J><E>
And he would have eaten more, too, if it hadn't been for just one thing.
</E></T>
<T><J>
一ぴきの犬が吠え声を立てました。
</J><E>
A dog barked.
</E></T>
<T><J>
それで、ふとっちょの楽しみは台なしになってしまいました。
</J><E>
And that spoiled Fatty's fun.
</E></T>
<T><J>
犬の吠え声は、ふとっちょが危険にかんじるほど、とても近いところで聞こえました。
</J><E>
For the dog was altogether too near for Fatty to feel safe.
</E></T>
<T><J>
彼がかじりかけのとうもろこしの実をほうり出すほどの、近い場所でした。
</J><E>
He even dropped the ear of corn he was gnawing 
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょは、森にむかって急いで逃げ出しました。
</J><E>
and hurried toward the woods.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
4 すぐに駆け出したのは、ふとっちょにとって幸運でした。
</J><E>
It was lucky for Fatty that he started when he did. 
</E></T>
<T><J>
時間をおかずに、犬が彼の背後にせまってきたからです。
</J><E>
For that dog was close behind him in no time.
</E></T>
<T><J>
することは一つしかありません。
</J><E>
There was only one thing to do:
</E></T>
<T><J>
ただちに木に登らなければいけないということを、ふとっちょは知っていました。
</J><E>
Fatty knew that he must climb a tree at once.
</E></T>
<T><J>
それで、まぢかにあって目に入ったおあつらえ向きの木に登りました
</J><E>
So he made for the nearest tree in sight
</E></T>
<T><J>
――大きくて、枝が横に広がった、オークの木でした。
</J><E>
--a big, spreading oak, 
</E></T>
<T><J>
その木は、柵の上におおいかぶさるようにして、一本だけ森から離れて立っていました。
</J><E>
which stood all alone just beyond the fence.
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょは大枝の上でうずくまると、すっかり安全になったように思いました。
</J><E>
And as Fatty crouched on a limb he felt safe enough,
</E></T>
<T><J>
それなのに犬は、吠えたり、鼻を鳴らしたり、木に飛びついたり、たいそう大騒ぎしました。
</J><E>
though the dog barked and whined, and leaped against the tree, and made a great fuss.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
5 ふとっちょは犬を見下ろして、少々しかってやりました。
</J><E>
Fatty looked down at the dog and scolded a little.
</E></T>
<T><J>
犬は恐くありませんでした。
</J><E>
He was not afraid.
</E></T>
<T><J>
けれど、とうもろこし畑から追い払われたことで、腹が立ちました。
</J><E>
But it made him cross to be driven out of the cornfield. 
</E></T>
<T><J>
犬なんかどこかに行ってしまえばいいのにと思いました。
</J><E>
And he wished the dog would go away.
</E></T>
<T><J>
けれど犬は
</J><E>
But the dog
</E></T>
<T><J>
――農夫のグリーンの飼犬で、スポットといいました
</J><E>
--it was Farmer Green's Spot
</E></T>
<T><J>
――立ち去るつもりはありませんでした。
</J><E>
--the dog had no idea of leaving.
</E></T>
<T><J>
犬は木の下にいつづけて、ひどく大声で吠え立てました。
</J><E>
He stayed right there and barked so loudly
</E></T>
<T><J>
ほどなくすると、農夫のグリーンと農場の作男がやって来る姿が見えました。
</J><E>
that it was not long before Farmer Green and his hired man came in sight.
</E></T>
<T><J>
ジョニー・グリーンと、つい最近ジョニーがもらった小さな子犬も、彼らと一緒でした。
</J><E>
And with them was Johnnie Green and a little, young dog that had just been given to him.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
6 農夫のグリーンは、ふとっちょを見て、がっかりした様子でした。
</J><E>
When Farmer Green saw Fatty he seemed disappointed.
</E></T>
<T><J>
「手をわずらわすには小さすぎる」
</J><E>
"He's too young to bother with,"
</E></T>
<T><J>
と、グリーンは言いました。
</J><E>
he said.
</E></T>
<T><J>
「あいつの毛皮はいくらにもならんよ。
</J><E>
"His skin's not worth much.
</E></T>
<T><J>
行こう、ほかにいるか探そう」
</J><E>
We'll go 'long and see what we can find."
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
7 けれど、ジョニー・グリーンはあとに残りました。
</J><E>
But Johnnie Green stayed behind.
</E></T>
<T><J>
彼は、あのあらいぐまの子が欲しかったのです。
</J><E>
He wanted that young coon.
</E></T>
<T><J>
そして、つかまえるつもりでもありました。
</J><E>
And he intended to have him, too.
</E></T>
<T><J>
子犬をふとっちょあらいぐまの見張りに残して、ジョニーは農家の母屋に戻りました。
</J><E>
Leaving the young dog to watch Fatty Coon, Johnnie went back to the farmhouse.
</E></T>
<T><J>
しばらくすると、ジョニーは肩に斧をかついだ姿で、またあらわれました。
</J><E>
After a while he appeared again with an axe over his shoulder.
</E></T>
<T><J>
そして、オークの大木を切り始めました。
</J><E>
And when he began to chop away at the big oak,
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょあらいぐまは、ひどく不安になりました。
</J><E>
Fatty Coon felt very uneasy.
</E></T>
<T><J>
ジョニーが斧を木にたたき込むたびに、木と一緒にふとっちょもふるえました。
</J><E>
Whenever Johnnie drove his axe into the tree, both the tree and Fatty shivered together.
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょは、とうもろこし畑から逃げ出せたらいいのにと願い始めました。
</J><E>
And Fatty began to wish he had stayed away from the cornfield. 
</E></T>
<T><J>
しかし、それも長いことではありませんでした。
</J><E>
But not for long,
</E></T>
<T><J>
ジョニー・グリーンが、オークの大木を切りたおすという考えを、さっさとあきらめたからです。
</J><E>
because Johnnie Green soon gave up the idea of chopping down the big oak.
</E></T>
<T><J>
木は、切るのには固すぎ、そして大きすぎました。
</J><E>
The wood was so hard to cut, and the tree was so big,
</E></T>
<T><J>
長い時間かかったのちに夜通しかかることが分かる前に、ジョニーは切るのを止めました。
</J><E>
that Johnnie had not chopped long before he saw that it would take him all night to cut through it.
</E></T>
<T><J>
ジョニーは、もの欲しげにふとっちょあらいぐまを見上げました。
</J><E>
He looked up longingly at Fatty Coon. 
</E></T>
<T><J>
そして、彼みずから木に登り始めました。
</J><E>
And Johnnie started to climb the tree himself.
</E></T>
<T><J>
けれど、ジョニーが登ると、ふとっちょはそれだけ上に登りました。
</J><E>
But the higher he climbed, the higher Fatty climbed.
</E></T>
<T><J>
このやり方では、ふとったあらいぐまの子を決してつかまえられないことを、ジョニーは知りました。
</J><E>
And Johnnie knew that he could never catch that plump young coon in that way.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
8 とうとう、ジョニー・グリーンは歩き出しました。
</J><E>
At last Johnnie Green started off, 
</E></T>
<T><J>
子犬も、彼に呼ばれてあとについていきました。
</J><E>
calling his dog after him. 
</E></T>
<T><J>
それから、ふとっちょあらいぐまは下におりました。
</J><E>
And then Fatty Coon came down. 
</E></T>
<T><J>
でも、とうもろこし畑には戻りませんでした。
</J><E>
But he did not go back to the cornfield.
</E></T>
<T><J>
ひと晩の冒険としてはもうじゅうぶん、ということにしたのです。
</J><E>
He decided that he had had adventures enough for one night. 
</E></T>
<T><J>
けれど、学ぶことはありました
</J><E>
But Fatty had learned something
</E></T>
<T><J>
――少なくとも、ふとっちょはそう思いました。
</J><E>
--at least he thought he had.
</E></T>
<T><J>
いったん木に登ってしまえば、人間はだれも彼に触れることができないのだと、決め込んだのです。
</J><E>
For he made up his mind that once he climbed a tree, no man could reach him.
</E></T>
<T><J>
〈木を切りたおすことはできない！〉
</J><E>
TREES COULD NOT BE CHOPPED DOWN!
</E></T>
<T><J>
と、ふとっちょは信じ込んでしまったのです。
</J><E>
That was what Fatty believed.
</E></T>
<T><J>
いつか、ふとっちょが間違いだったと知るときが来るのかどうか、みなさんはたぶんあとでお分かりになるでしょう。
</J><E>
Perhaps you will know, later, whether Fatty ever found out that he was mistaken.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
ぞっとするような恐怖
</J><E>
VIII
A TERRIBLE FRIGHT
</E></T>
<T><J>
1 ふとっちょあらいぐまが、老犬スポットに追われてとうもろこし畑のそばのオークの大木に登った、次の晩でした。
</J><E>
It was the very next night after old dog Spot had treed Fatty Coon in the big oak near the cornfield.
</E></T>
<T><J>
農夫のグリーンの家では、夕食を食べおわったところでした。
</J><E>
They had finished their evening meal at Farmer Green's house.
</E></T>
<T><J>
牛の乳をしぼり、馬にかいばをやり、ニワトリはすべて鳥小屋の中にしまわれました。
</J><E>
The cows were milked, the horses had been fed, the chickens had all gone to roost.
</E></T>
<T><J>
農夫のグリーンは、ブルー山の山かげからのぼる月を見上げました。
</J><E>
And Farmer Green looked up at the moon, rising from behind Blue Mountain.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
2 「今夜もあらいぐま狩りに行くぞ」
</J><E>
"We'll go coon-hunting again to-night,"
</E></T>
<T><J>
彼は、ジョニーと作男に言いました。
</J><E>
he said to Johnnie and the hired man.
</E></T>
<T><J>
「沼のあらいぐまども、とうもろこしにつられてまた出て来るはずだ。
</J><E>
"The corn has brought the coons up from the swamp.
</E></T>
<T><J>
月が少しかげったら、すぐ出発だぞ」
</J><E>
We'll start as soon as it grows a little darker."
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
3 さあ
</J><E>
Well
</E></T>
<T><J>
――しばらくすると、彼らはとうもろこし畑に出かけました。
</J><E>
--after a while they set out for the cornfield.
</E></T>
<T><J>
やっぱりです！
</J><E>
And sure enough!
</E></T>
<T><J>
老犬スポットが、ほえ始めました。
</J><E>
old Spot soon began to bark.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
4 「スポットが木に追いこんだぞ！」
</J><E>
"He's treed!" 
</E></T>
<T><J>
すぐさま農夫のグリーンが言いました。
</J><E>
said Farmer Green, pretty soon.
</E></T>
<T><J>
彼らはそろって、森のふちを目指して急ぎました。
</J><E>
And they all hurried over to the edge of the woods,
</E></T>
<T><J>
そこでスポットが、あらいぐまを背の高いクリの木に追いこんでいました。
</J><E>
where Spot had chased a coon up into a tall chestnut tree.
</E></T>
<T><J>
月明かりの下で、彼らはあらいぐまの姿をまざまざと見ることができました。
</J><E>
In the moonlight they could see the coon quite plainly.
</E></T>
<T><J>
「別のちっこいやつだ！」
</J><E>
"Another little feller!"
</E></T>
<T><J>
農夫のグリーンがさけびました。
</J><E>
cried Farmer Green.
</E></T>
<T><J>
「まいったね。
</J><E>
"I declare,
</E></T>
<T><J>
とうもろこし畑にやって来るあらいぐまは、どれもこれも子どもなのかい。
</J><E>
all the coons that come to the cornfield seem to be young ones.
</E></T>
<T><J>
昨日の晩おれたちが見たやつよりも、小さいじゃないか」
</J><E>
This one's no bigger than the one we saw last night."
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
5 とはいうものの、農夫のグリーンには、高い木の上にいるのがふとっちょあらいぐまだということなど、わかりっこありませんでした。
</J><E>
Now, although Farmer Green never guessed it, it was Fatty Coon who was up there in the tall chestnut.
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょはこのとき、もう少しで森の中に逃げこむところでした。
</J><E>
He had run almost to the woods this time, 
</E></T>
<T><J>
ですが、その手前で、木に登らねばなりませんでした。
</J><E>
before he had to take to a tree.
</E></T>
<T><J>
じつのところ、スポットがあれほど近くまでふとっちょにせまらなかったら、ふとっちょは森の中にたどり着き、木から木へと飛び移って逃げ去ることができました。
</J><E>
In fact, if Spot hadn't been quite so close to him Fatty could have reached the woods, and then he would have just jumped from one tree to another.
</E></T>
<T><J>
しかし、大きなクリの木のまわりには、飛び移れるほど近くに木がなかったのです。
</J><E>
But there were no trees near enough the big chestnut for that.
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょはそこにとどまり、人間たちが行ってしまうまで待たねばなりませんでした。
</J><E>
Fatty had to stay right there and wait for those men to pass on.
</E></T>
<T><J>
彼は、おそれてはいませんでした。
</J><E>
He wasn't afraid.
</E></T>
<T><J>
大きな木の上で、すっかり安心しきっていました。
</J><E>
He felt perfectly safe in his big tree.
</E></T>
<T><J>
ジョニー・グリーンが父親にこう言ったときも、彼はほほ笑みを浮かべただけでした――
</J><E>
And he only smiled when Johnnie Green said to his father--
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
6 「ぼく、あのあらいぐまの子がほしいよ。
</J><E>
"I wish I had that young coon.
</E></T>
<T><J>
あいつはかわいいペットになるよ」
</J><E>
He'd make a fine pet."
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
7 「ペットだと！」
</J><E>
"A pet!"
</E></T>
<T><J>
農夫のグリーンがさけびました。
</J><E>
exclaimed Farmer Green.
</E></T>
<T><J>
「キツネをペットにして、ニワトリを盗まれたのを忘れたのか？」
</J><E>
"You remember that pet fox you had, that stole my chickens?"
</E></T>
<T><J>
8 「気をつけるからさ」
</J><E>
"Oh, I'd be careful,"
</E></T>
<T><J>
ジョニーは約束しました。
</J><E>
Johnnie promised.
</E></T>
<T><J>
「それに、つかまえたほうがいいと思わないの？　
</J><E>
"Besides, don't you think we ought to catch him,
</E></T>
<T><J>
そうすれば、あいつももうとうもろこしを食べないよ」
</J><E>
so he won't eat any more corn?"
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
9 農夫のグリーンはほほ笑みました。
</J><E>
Farmer Green smiled.
</E></T>
<T><J>
彼自身も、大昔は少年でした。
</J><E>
He had been a boy himself, once upon a time,
</E></T>
<T><J>
ちょうどジョニーくらいの年ごろに、あらいぐまをペットにしたことがあったのを忘れてはいなかったのです。
</J><E>
and he had not forgotten the pet coon that he had owned when he was just about Johnnie's age.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
10 「いいだろう！」
</J><E>
"All right!"
</E></T>
<T><J>
グリーンはとうとう言いました。
</J><E>
he said at last.
</E></T>
<T><J>
「もう一度だけチャンスをやるぞ、ジョニー。
</J><E>
"I'll give you one more chance, Johnnie.
</E></T>
<T><J>
だが、あのあらいぐまの子がおれの鳥を殺さないよう、おれが見張るはめになるんだろうな」
</J><E>
But you'll have to see that this young coon doesn't kill any of my poultry."
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
11 ジョニーは、そのようなことにはならないと約束しました。
</J><E>
Johnnie promised that nothing of the sort should happen.
</E></T>
<T><J>
それから、彼の父親と作男は、斧をとり上げました。
</J><E>
And then his father and the hired man picked up their axes;
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふたりは高いクリの木をはさんで向かい合わせに立つと、木を切り始めました。
</J><E>
and standing on opposite sides of the tall chestnut tree, they began to chop.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
12 なんとまあ、木くずが飛ぶこと！　
</J><E>
How the chips did fly!
</E></T>
<T><J>
最初の一げきから、ふとっちょにもわかりました。
</J><E>
At the very first blow Fatty knew
</E></T>
<T><J>
今度のは、前の晩にジョニーがしようとしたのとは、切り方がまるでちがいました。
</J><E>
that this was an entirely different sort of chopping from that which Johnnie had attempted the night before.
</E></T>
<T><J>
大木はまるで、ほどなくして地面に打ちたおされることを知っているかのように、身をふるわせました。
</J><E>
The great tree shook as if it knew that it would soon come crashing down upon the ground.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
13 ふとっちょあらいぐまはというと、先のことはわかりませんでしたが、木がたおされるときには自分も落ちるのだろうと思いました。
</J><E>
And as for Fatty Coon, he could not see but that he must fall when the tree did.
</E></T>
<T><J>
彼もまた、恐ろしさに身をふるわせました。
</J><E>
He, too, shivered and shook.
</E></T>
<T><J>
大枝のまわりに自分の体をすっかり巻きつけ、できるだけしっかりとしがみつき、じっと動かないようにしました。
</J><E>
And he wrapped himself all the way around a limb and hung on as tight as ever he could.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
ジョニー・グリーン、ペットをとり逃す
</J><E>
IX
JOHNNIE GREEN LOSES HIS PET
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
1 さて、農夫のグリーンと作男は、すぐに木を切るのを止め、息をつきました。
</J><E>
Now, Farmer Green and his hired man had not chopped long before they stopped to breathe.
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふたりは少しの間しか切っていませんでした
</J><E>
They had not chopped long
</E></T>
<T><J>
――けれど、まあ！　
</J><E>
--but oh!
</E></T>
<T><J>
大きなクリの木に、大きな穴がぱっくりと口を開いていました！　
</J><E>
what great, yawning holes they had made in the big chestnut!
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょあらいぐまは、しがみついていた大枝から、下を見おろしました。
</J><E>
From the limb where he clung Fatty Coon looked down.
</E></T>
<T><J>
木はもうそれ以上ゆれませんでした。
</J><E>
The tree no longer shook.
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょは、また安心しました。
</J><E>
And Fatty felt better at once.
</E></T>
<T><J>
ほら、前の晩のジョニーのように、行ってしまうのだと思ったものですからね。
</J><E>
You see, he thought that the men would go away, just as Johnnie had gone away the night before.
</E></T>
<T><J>
けれど彼らは、そんなつもりはちっともありませんでした。
</J><E>
But they had no such idea at all.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
2 「彼女をどっちに倒すんですかい？」
</J><E>
"Which way are you going to fell her?"
</E></T>
<T><J>
作男がたずねました。
</J><E>
the hired man asked.
</E></T>
<T><J>
〈彼女〉というのは、〈木〉のことですよ、もちろんね。
</J><E>
He said HER, meaning the TREE, of course.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
3 「こっちだ！」
</J><E>
"That way!"
</E></T>
<T><J>
農夫のグリーンは、森のほうを指さして言いました。
</J><E>
said Farmer Green, pointing toward the woods.
</E></T>
<T><J>
「こっちに倒さないといかん。
</J><E>
"We'll have to drop her that way,
</E></T>
<T><J>
さもないと、彼女が道をすっかりふさいじまう。
</J><E>
or she'll fall right across the road,
</E></T>
<T><J>
もちろん、そんなことは絶対にするわけにいかんよ」
</J><E>
and of course THAT would never do."
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
4 「しかし、彼女、森のはしの木をなぎ倒しちまうんじゃないかね？」
</J><E>
"But will she clear the trees on the edge of the woods?" 
</E></T>
<T><J>
作男は、いくぶん疑わしげな顔をしました。
</J><E>
The hired man appeared somewhat doubtful.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
5 「ああ、たしかに
</J><E>
"Oh, to be sure
</E></T>
<T><J>
――たしかにな！」
</J><E>
--to be sure!"
</E></T>
<T><J>
農夫のグリーンが答えました。
</J><E>
answered Farmer Green.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
6 そして、ふたりはふたたび仕事を始めました。
</J><E>
And with that they set to work again.
</E></T>
<T><J>
けれど今度は、ふたりそろって木の同じがわを切りました
</J><E>
But this time they both chopped on the same side of the tree
</E></T>
<T><J>
――森のほうのがわをです。
</J><E>
--the side toward the woods.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
7 さて、前回ふとっちょあらいぐまがおびえたとしたら、大きなクリの木がかしぎ始めたとき、彼がますますおびえたことを、みなさんも疑わないでしょう。
</J><E>
Now, if Fatty Coon was frightened before, you will believe that he was still more frightened when the big chestnut tree began to sag.
</E></T>
<T><J>
そうなのです！　
</J><E>
Yes!
</E></T>
<T><J>
クリの木が、森のほうに向かってかしぎ始めたのです。
</J><E>
it began to lean toward the woods. 
</E></T>
<T><J>
ゆっくり、ゆっくり、かしいでいったのです。
</J><E>
Slowly, slowly it tipped.
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょは、恐ろしさに半分くるったようになりました。
</J><E>
And Fatty was scared half out of his mind.
</E></T>
<T><J>
彼は木のてっぺんに登りました。
</J><E>
He climbed to the very top of the tree,
</E></T>
<T><J>
できるだけ人間たちから遠ざかっていたかったのです。
</J><E>
because he wanted to get just as far away from those men as he could.
</E></T>
<T><J>
そして、待ちました。
</J><E>
And there he waited.
</E></T>
<T><J>
ほかにどうすることも出来ません。
</J><E>
There was nothing else he could do.
</E></T>
<T><J>
そうですとも！　
</J><E>
Yes!
</E></T>
<T><J>
彼は、木が音をたてて地面に倒れる、来るべき恐ろしい瞬間がおとずれるのを待ちました。
</J><E>
he waited until that awful moment should come when the tree would go crashing down upon the ground.
</E></T>
<T><J>
それから、なにが起きるのかしら？　
</J><E>
What was going to happen to him then?
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょは、首をかしげました。
</J><E>
Fatty wondered.
</E></T>
<T><J>
彼が考えている間に、木が裂けるメリメリという大きな音が、一どきに鳴りひびきました。
</J><E>
And while he was wondering there sounded all at once a great snapping and splitting.
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょは、木がどんどん、どんどん、かしいでいくのをかんじました。
</J><E>
And Fatty felt the tree falling, falling.
</E></T>
<T><J>
ジョニー・グリーンがさけび声をあげるのが聞こえました。
</J><E>
He could hear Johnnie Green shouting.
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょは、目をかたく閉じ、枝にしっかりとつかまりました。
</J><E>
And he shut his eyes and held fast to his branch.
</E></T>
<T><J>
それから、ドシンという衝撃におそわれました。
</J><E>
Then came the crash.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
8 目を開けたとき、ふとっちょあらいぐまは、ジョニー・グリーンがいまにも自分をつかまえようとしているところが見えるのだと思っていました。
</J><E>
When Fatty Coon opened his eyes he expected to see Johnnie Green all ready to seize him.
</E></T>
<T><J>
ところが、おどろいたことに、地面はまだずっと下のほうにありました。
</J><E>
But to his great surprise he was still far above the ground.
</E></T>
<T><J>
ですからね、農夫のグリーンは、勘ちがいをしていたのですよ。
</J><E>
You see, Farmer Green had been mistaken.
</E></T>
<T><J>
大きなクリの木は、グリーンが見当をつけていたよりもずっと高かったし、森は、彼が考えていたよりもずっと近かったのです。
</J><E>
Either the big chestnut tree was taller than he had guessed, or the woods were nearer than he had thought.
</E></T>
<T><J>
そのために、ふとっちょがしがみついていた木は、地面にたおれる代わりに、森のはしのほかの木の上にたおれかかったのです。
</J><E>
For instead of dropping upon the ground, Fatty's tree had fallen right against another tree on the edge of the woods.
</E></T>
<T><J>
ほかの木の枝が、大きなクリの木の枝をしっかりととらえ、半分かしいだかっこうで横たわったのです。
</J><E>
And there it lay, half-tipped over, with its branches caught fast in the branches of that other tree.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
9 ジョニー・グリーンがさけび声をあげたのも、むりはありません。
</J><E>
It was no wonder that Johnnie Green shouted.
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょが大きなクリの木からとなりの木によじ登るのを見て、ジョニーはいっそう大きなさけび声をあげました。
</J><E>
And he shouted still more loudly when he saw Fatty scramble out of the big chestnut and into the other tree, 
</E></T>
<T><J>
そこからまたとなりの木に移り、そのまたとなりの木に移ると、ジョニーの声はどんどん大きくなりました。
</J><E>
and out of that tree and into another, and then out of THAT tree.
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょは、そのまま森に入っていきました。
</J><E>
Fatty was going straight into the woods.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
10 ジョニー・グリーンがさけび声をあげたのも、むりはありません。
</J><E>
It was no wonder that Johnnie Green shouted.
</E></T>
<T><J>
自分のペットのあらいぐまを逃してしまったのですから。
</J><E>
For he had lost his pet coon.
</E></T>
<T><J>
まだ一度もつかまえないうちからとり逃してしまったのですから。
</J><E>
He had lost him before he ever had him.
</E></T>
<T><J>
ジョニーはひどくがっかりしました。
</J><E>
And he was sadly disappointed.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
11 でも、ふとっちょあらいぐまは、がっかりしませんでした。
</J><E>
But Fatty Coon was not disappointed, 
</E></T>
<T><J>
ペットになんか、ちっともなりたくなかったのですから。
</J><E>
for he had not wanted to be a pet at all.
</E></T>
<T><J>
そして、大よろこびしました
</J><E>
And he was very glad
</E></T>
<T><J>
――みなさんだってそうでしょう
</J><E>
--you may be sure
</E></T>
<T><J>
――ふたたび安全なわが家に帰ることができるのですから。
</J><E>
--to get safely home once more.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょあらいぐまと怪物
</J><E>
X
FATTY COON AND THE MONSTER
</E></T>
<T><J>
1 ある晩、ふとっちょあらいぐまは、くねくねと曲がりくねった谷間の道を、ぶらぶら歩いていました。
</J><E>
One night Fatty Coon was strolling along the road that wound through the valley.
</E></T>
<T><J>
先を急いではいませんでした。
</J><E>
He was in no hurry,
</E></T>
<T><J>
農夫のグリーンのリンゴ畑で、食べられるだけのリンゴを飲みこむようにお腹に詰めこんできたばかりでしたから。
</J><E>
for he had just left Farmer Green's apple orchard, where he had bolted all the apples he could possibly eat.
</E></T>
<T><J>
まだそれほど夜おそくないというのに、辺りは暗く、この土地にくらす住民たちは、みなベッドに入って眠っているかのようでした。
</J><E>
The night was dark and though it was not very late, all the country people seemed to be in bed.
</E></T>
<T><J>
道を馬車で走ってくる農夫もいませんでした。
</J><E>
There were no farmers driving along the road.
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょは、すべてが自分のものであるというような、いい気分になっていました。
</J><E>
Fatty had it all to himself. 
</E></T>
<T><J>
ですから、家路にむかってのんびり歩いていました。
</J><E>
And so he walked slowly homewards.
</E></T>
<T><J>
そのときです。
</J><E>
It was then
</E></T>
<T><J>
恐ろしい怪物に、もうちょっとでつかまえられそうになったのは。
</J><E>
that the terrible monster almost caught him.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
2 それは、このようにして起こりました。
</J><E>
This is how it all happened.
</E></T>
<T><J>
ブル、ブル、ブル、ル、ル、ル、という音が、辺りにひびきわたりました。
</J><E>
There was a br-br-br-r-r-r in the air.
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょは、本当ならばもっとはやくその音が聞こえていなければいけませんでした。
</J><E>
Fatty really should have heard it long before he did.
</E></T>
<T><J>
でも、あんまりたくさんのリンゴを食べて、眠くなり始めていました。
</J><E>
But he had eaten so many apples that he had begun to feel sleepy;
</E></T>
<T><J>
耳がいつもよりもするどくなかったのです。
</J><E>
and his ears were not so sharp as they should have been.
</E></T>
<T><J>
ブル、ル、ル、ル、という音がようやくふとっちょの耳にとどいたとき、ずいぶん大きな音になっていました。
</J><E>
And when at last Fatty heard that br-r-r-r it was quite loud. 
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょは、ぎょっとしました。
</J><E>
He was startled.
</E></T>
<T><J>
そして、音をよく聞こうと、道のまん中で立ち止まりました。
</J><E>
And he stopped right in the middle of the road to listen.
</E></T>
<T><J>
そんな音は前には一度も聞いたことがありませんでした。
</J><E>
Fatty had never heard such a sound before.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
3 その奇妙な動物は、ふとっちょがそうと知る前に、おそいかかってきました。
</J><E>
The strange animal was on him before he knew it.
</E></T>
<T><J>
その動物のギラギラと光る目に、ふとっちょの目はくらまされました。
</J><E>
Its glaring eyes blinded him.
</E></T>
<T><J>
もしもその動物がふとっちょにむかって金切り声を出さなかったら、ふとっちょは決して逃げ出していなかったでしょう。
</J><E>
And if it had not screamed at him Fatty would never have escaped.
</E></T>
<T><J>
その怪物の金切り声のものすごさに、ふとっちょはとうとう飛びあがりました。
</J><E>
It was the terrible screech of the monster which finally made Fatty jump.
</E></T>
<T><J>
恐ろしいさけび声でした
</J><E>
It was a frightful cry
</E></T>
<T><J>
――まるで、六ぴきのヤマネコがいっせいに鳴きさけんだような声でした。
</J><E>
--like six wildcats all wailing together.
</E></T>
<T><J>
怪物につかまえられるまさに直前に、ふとっちょは道のはしに飛びのきました。
</J><E>
And Fatty leaped to one side of the road just before the monster reached him.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
4 巨大な生き物は、まるで丘を引きさく突風のようないきおいで、ふとっちょのわきを通りすぎました。
</J><E>
The great creature went past Fatty like the wind and tore on up the hill.
</E></T>
<T><J>
その生き物は、あんまりはやく走りすぎて、止まることができないようでした。
</J><E>
He seemed to be running so fast that he could not stop.
</E></T>
<T><J>
その生き物が道の急な登り坂にさしかかると、登りながらあえぐ声が、ふとっちょの耳に聞こえました。
</J><E>
Fatty could hear him panting as he climbed the sharp rise of the road.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
5 ふとっちょあらいぐまは、家にむかって急いで走りました。
</J><E>
Fatty Coon hurried away.
</E></T>
<T><J>
怪物が止まることができて、彼をさがしに戻ってくるといけません。
その前に家に帰りたかったのです。
</J><E>
He wanted to get home before the monster could stop and come back to look for him.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
6 危ないところで命びろいしたてんまつをふとっちょから聞かされると、あらいぐま夫人はひどく動ようしました。
</J><E>
When Fatty told his mother about his narrow escape Mrs. Coon became much excited.
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょが見まちがえたわけではないと、彼女は信じました。
</J><E>
She felt sure that Fatty was not mistaken,
</E></T>
<T><J>
わたしが聞いたおかしなさけび声は、それだったのではないかしら？
</J><E>
for had she not heard that strange cry herself?
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
7 また聞こえました！　
</J><E>
There it was again!
</E></T>
<T><J>
ウウウ、ウウウ、ウウウ、ウウ、ウ！　
</J><E>
Woo-ooo-ooo-oo-o!
</E></T>
<T><J>
始めは低いうなり声だったのが、高まって金切り声になり、そして、ふたたび消え入りました。
</J><E>
It began low, rose to a shriek, and then died away again.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
8 あらいぐま夫人とふとっちょは、わが家である古いポプラの木のてっぺんに登り、谷間を見下ろしました。
</J><E>
Mrs. Coon and Fatty climbed to the very top of their old poplar and gazed down the valley.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
9 「見て、お母さん！」
</J><E>
"Look, Mother!" 
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょがさけびました。
</J><E>
Fatty cried.
</E></T>
<T><J>
「農夫のグリーンさんの家で止まってる！　
</J><E>
"He's stopped at Farmer Green's!
</E></T>
<T><J>
ここからでもあいつの目が見えるよ！」
</J><E>
You can see his eyes from here!"
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
10 あらいぐま夫人は、そちらを見ました。
</J><E>
Mrs. Coon looked.
</E></T>
<T><J>
まあ、本当だ！　
</J><E>
Sure enough!
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょが言ったとおりでした。
</J><E>
It was just as Fatty said.
</E></T>
<T><J>
その怪物の恐ろしいさけび声が、ふたたび谷間にこだましました。
</J><E>
And that horrid call echoed across the valley once more.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
11 農夫のグリーンは、自動車に乗った男の頼みごとをよく聞こうと、寝室の窓から外に頭をつき出しました。
</J><E>
Farmer Green stuck his head out of his chamber-window, to see what the man in the automobile wanted.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
12 「ここから一番近い村の場所を教えていただけませんか？」
</J><E>
"Where's the nearest village, please?"
</E></T>
<T><J>
と、そのよそ者はたずねました。
</J><E>
the stranger asked.
</E></T>
<T><J>
農夫のグリーンが教えてやると、男はまた自動車を走らせました。
</J><E>
And after Farmer Green had told him the man drove his car on again.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
13 ふとっちょとお母さんは、お家の木のてっぺんから、怪物がすごいいきおいで谷間をつっ切っていくのをながめました。
</J><E>
From their tree-top Fatty and his mother watched the monster dash down the valley.
</E></T>
<T><J>
怪物が去っていくのが、ふたりにはわかりました。
</J><E>
They knew he had gone,
</E></T>
<T><J>
なぜなら、ギラギラ光る恐ろしい目が、遠くからでも見えましたから。
</J><E>
because they could see the gleam of those awful eyes.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
14 「あの怪物、農夫のグリーンさんとグリーンさんの家族を食べちゃったの？」
</J><E>
"Do you suppose he ate up Farmer Green and his family?"
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょは、おびえた声でたずねました。
</J><E>
Fatty asked in a frightened voice.

</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
15 「そうだといいよ」
</J><E>
"I hope so,"
</E></T>
<T><J>
お母さんは言いました。
</J><E>
she said.
</E></T>
<T><J>
「そしたら、もう森の中にわなをしかけられなくなるかもしれないからね」
</J><E>
"Then perhaps there'll be no more traps in theb woods."
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
16 「でも、だれがとうもろこしを作ってくれるの？」
</J><E>
"But who would plant the corn?" 
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょはたずねました。
</J><E>
Fatty asked.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
17 あらいぐま夫人には、ふとっちょの質問が聞こえないようでした。
</J><E>
Mrs. Coon did not appear to hear his question.

JASPER JAY TELLS SOME NEWS
</E></T>
<T><J>
1 秋がとっぷりとふかまり、辺りがひどく冷えこんできました。
</J><E>
It was quite late in the fall, and the weather had grown very cold.
</E></T>
<T><J>
あらいぐま夫人とその子どもたちは、数日のあいだ家の中に閉じこもりっきりでいました。
</J><E>
Mrs. Coon and her family had not left their home for several days;
</E></T>
<T><J>
けれどこの日、あらいぐま夫人は、お陽さまの照る外に出て新せんな空気をすい、ごはんを食べたら気持ちがよかろうと考えました。
</J><E>
but on this day she thought it would be pleasant to go out in the sunshine and get a breath of fresh air and a bite to eat.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
2 ふとっちょは、あらいぐま夫人の子どもたちの中で、ひとりだけ眠っていませんでした。
</J><E>
Fatty was the only one of her children that was not asleep;
</E></T>
<T><J>
そして、ひどい空腹をうったえました。
</J><E>
and he complained of being very hungry.
</E></T>
<T><J>
そこであらいぐま夫人は、ふとっちょを一緒に連れていくことにしました。
</J><E>
So Mrs. Coon decided to take him with her.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
3 狩りはおもわしくありませんでした。
</J><E>
The hunting was not very good.
</E></T>
<T><J>
鳥の卵は、木々の中のどこにも見つかりませんでした。
</J><E>
There were no birds' eggs at all to be found in the trees.
</E></T>
<T><J>
大きい川や、小さい川や、もっと小さい川は、すべて凍りついていましたので、ふとっちょとお母さんは魚をつかまえることができませんでした。
</J><E>
The river and the brook and the creek were all frozen over, so Fatty and his mother could not catch any fish.
</E></T>
<T><J>
そして、とうもろこしはというと
</J><E>
And as for corn
</E></T>
<T><J>
――農夫のグリーンが、とうのむかしに最後の実をつみ取ってしまっていました。
</J><E>
--Farmer Green had long ago gathered the last ear of it.
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょは、今が夏だったらいいのにと思いました。
</J><E>
Fatty wished that it was summertime.
</E></T>
<T><J>
けれど、夏のめぐみのおいしい食べ物のことを考えると、ますますお腹が空いてしまうだけでした。
</J><E>
But it only made him hungrier than ever, to think of all the good things to eat that summer brings. 
</E></T>
<T><J>
お母さんがするどい声でこう言ったときには、ふとっちょはすっかりみじめな気分になってしまいました。
</J><E>
He was feeling very unhappy when his mother said to him sharply--
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
4 「その木に登りなさい！　
</J><E>
"Run up this tree!
</E></T>
<T><J>
急いで！　
</J><E>
Hurry, now!
</E></T>
<T><J>
なにも聞くんじゃないよ」
</J><E>
Don't ask any questions."
</E></T>
<T><J>
5 さて、いつものふとっちょは、お母さんを気づかうなんてことは、すぐにそうしたってよさそうなときだって、しやしませんでした。
</J><E>
Now, Fatty did not always mind his mother as quickly as he might have.
</E></T>
<T><J>
ところがこのとき、お母さんが立ち止まり、辺りの空気のにおいをかぎ回ったのには、すぐに気づきました。
</J><E>
But this time he saw that she had stopped and was sniffing the air 
</E></T>
<T><J>
お母さんはまるで、なにか気に入らないものがあるような様子でした。
</J><E>
as if there was something about it she did not like.
</E></T>
<T><J>
6 ふとっちょにはそれだけでじゅうぶんでした。
</J><E>
That was enough for Fatty.
</E></T>
<T><J>
彼は、手近な木に大急ぎで登りました。
</J><E>
He scrambled up the nearest tree. 
</E></T>
<T><J>
お母さんがなにか危険なものを見つけたということが、彼にはわかったからです。
</J><E>
For he knew that his mother had discovered danger of some sort.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
7 あらいぐま夫人は、ふとっちょのすぐ後ろからぴったりついてきました。
</J><E>
Mrs. Coon followed close behind Fatty.
</E></T>
<T><J>
そして、ふたりそろって枝葉の中に隠れるやいなや、お母さんがかぎ取ったものの正体が、姿をあらわしました。
</J><E>
And they had. no sooner hidden in the branches than Fatty saw what it was that his mother had smelled.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
8 ジョニー・グリーンです！　
</J><E>
It was Johnnie Green!
</E></T>
<T><J>
ジョニーは、ふとっちょたちが身をひそめている木の真下を通りすぎました。
</J><E>
He passed right underneath the tree where they were perched.
</E></T>
<T><J>
あらいぐま夫人は、ジョニーを盗み見て、ブルブルガタガタと、それはひどく身をふるわせました。
</J><E>
And as Mrs. Coon peeped down at him she shuddered and shivered and shook so hard 
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょは、そんなお母さんに気づかずにはいられませんでした。
</J><E>
that Fatty couldn't help noticing it.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
9 「いったいどうしたの？」
</J><E>
"What's the matter?" 
</E></T>
<T><J>
ジョニー・グリーンの姿が見えなくなると、ふとっちょはすぐさまたずねました。
</J><E>
he asked, as soon as Johnnie Green was out of sight.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
10　「ぼうしさ！」
</J><E>
"His cap!"
</E></T>
<T><J>
あらいぐま夫人がさけびました。
</J><E>
Mrs. Coon exclaimed.
</E></T>
<T><J>
「あの子のかぶってるのはね、あらいぐまの毛皮のぼうしなんだよ！」
</J><E>
"He is wearing a coon-skin cap!"
</E></T>
<T><J>
さあ、あらいぐま夫人が腹を立てているのかどうか、みなさんはわかりますよね？　
</J><E>
Now do you wonder that she was upset?
</E></T>
<T><J>
「農夫のグリーンの家の近くには絶対に行っちゃいけないよ」
</J><E>
"Don't ever go near Farmer Green's house," 
</E></T>
<T><J>
あらいぐま夫人は、ふとっちょに注意しました。
</J><E>
she warned Fatty.
</E></T>
<T><J>
「ぼうしとか、てぶくろとか、コートとか、そういうもんになりたくないだろう？」
</J><E>
"You don't want to be made into a cap, or a pair of gloves, or a coat, or anything like that, do you?"
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
11 「もちろんだよ、お母さん！」
</J><E>
"No, indeed, Mother!"
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょは、心から自信を持って言いました。
</J><E>
Fatty was quite sure 
</E></T>
<T><J>
そんな冒険は、ちっとも楽しくないに決まっています。
</J><E>
that such an adventure wouldn't please him at all.
</E></T>
<T><J>
そしてその場で、農夫のグリーンの家にはこんりんざい近寄らないぞと、自分自身に言い聞かせました。
</J><E>
And he told himself right then and there that he would never go anywhere near Farmer Green's house.
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょがどのくらいちゃんと覚えていられるのか、わたしたちはこれから知ることになるでしょう。
</J><E>
We shall see how well Fatty remembered.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
12 その午後、ふとっちょあらいぐまは、たいそうごきげんな話を聞きました。
</J><E>
That very afternoon Fatty Coon heard some very pleasant news.
</E></T>
<T><J>
カケスのジャスパーから聞いたことです。
</J><E>
It was Jasper Jay who told him.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
13 カケスのジャスパーは、とてもそうぞうしいアオカケスで、沼に住んでいるふとっちょたちの隣人でした。
</J><E>
Jasper Jay was a very noisy blue jay who lived in the neighborhood.
</E></T>
<T><J>
ほかの多くの鳥たちは、寒くなると南にわたりますが、彼はそうしませんでした。
</J><E>
He did not go south with most of the other birds when the cold weather came.
</E></T>
<T><J>
彼は、冬が好きなのです。
</J><E>
He liked the winter
</E></T>
<T><J>
そして、森のいたるところでひっきりなしにわめき立てたり、うるさく口出しをして、つねに森の住民を困らせていました。
</J><E>
and he was forever tearing about the woods, squalling and scolding at everybody.
</E></T>
<T><J>
彼は、たいそうな騒動好きなのです。
</J><E>
He was a very noisy fellow.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
14 そしてね！　
</J><E>
Well!
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょとお母さんは狩りをおえて家にもどると、ふとっちょは家の外にとどまりました。
</J><E>
when Fatty and his mother had reached home after their hunt, Fatty stayed out of doors.
</E></T>
<T><J>
彼は、高いマツの木のてっぺん近くまで登ると、手足を伸ばし、広い背中にお陽さまの光があたる心地よさを楽しみました。
</J><E>
He climbed to the top of a tall pine tree nearby and stretched himself along a limb, to enjoy the sunshine, which felt very good upon his broad back.
</E></T>
<T><J>
そこをカケスのジャスパーが見つけて、ごきげんな話を教えたのでした。
</J><E>
It was there that Jasper Jay found him and told him the pleasant news.
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょは、その話を聞いて大よろこびしました。
</J><E>
And Fatty was very glad to hear the news,
</E></T>
<T><J>
なぜなら、まだお腹が空いていたからです。
</J><E>
because he was still hungry.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
15 カケスのジャスパーがふとっちょに話したこととは、こういうことです。
</J><E>
This is what Jasper Jay told Fatty:
</E></T>
<T><J>
農夫のグリーンは、四十羽くらいのふとった七面鳥を飼っており、グリーンの家の前庭に生えている枝をひろげたオークの木に、毎晩鳥小屋代わりにとまらせている、というのです。
</J><E>
he told him that Farmer Green had as many as forty fat turkeys, which roosted every night in a spreading oak in Farmer Green's front yard.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
16 「ぼくが七面鳥好きだったら、ぜったい夜にそこに行って、しっけいしちゃうね」
</J><E>
"If I liked turkeys I would certainly go down there some night and get one," 
</E></T>
<T><J>
と、カケスのジャスパーは言いました。
</J><E>
said Jasper Jay.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
四十羽のふとった七面鳥
</J><E>
XII
FORTY FAT TURKEYS
</E></T>
<T><J>
1 カケスのジャスパーから農夫のグリーンの四十羽のふとった七面鳥のことを聞くと、ふとっちょはこれまでにないくらいお腹が空いてきました。
</J><E>
When Jasper Jay told Fatty Coon about Farmer Green's forty fat turkeys Fatty felt hungrier than ever.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
2 「あーあ！　
</J><E>
"Oh!
</E></T>
<T><J>
ぼくは農夫のグリーンさんの家に近づいちゃだめなんだ！」
</J><E>
I mustn't go near Farmer Green's house!"
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょは言いました。
</J><E>
he said.
</E></T>
<T><J>
「お母さんが離れていなさいって言ったんだもの
</J><E>
"My mother told me to keep away from there.
</E></T>
<T><J>
……七面鳥が鳥小屋にいくのはいつって言ったっけ？」
</J><E>
. . . What time did you say the turkeys go to roost?"
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
3 「毎晩陽がしずんだときさ」
</J><E>
"Oh! they go to roost every night at sundown," 
</E></T>
<T><J>
カケスのジャスパーは説明しました。
</J><E>
Jasper Jay explained.
</E></T>
<T><J>
「夜じゅう木の上にいるんだよ。
</J><E>
"And there they sit, up in the tree, all night long.
</E></T>
<T><J>
そこでぐっすり眠ってるんだ。
</J><E>
They're fast asleep.
</E></T>
<T><J>
きみが欲しいだけいくらでも簡単につかまえられるよ
</J><E>
And you would have no trouble at all in catching as many as you wanted.
</E></T>
<T><J>
……でももちろん、恐いんなら
</J><E>
. . . But of course, if you're afraid
</E></T>
<T><J>
――ぼくの言うことなんか聞かなくたっていいよ。
</J><E>
--why there's no use of MY talking about it.
</E></T>
<T><J>
このあたりの森に住むおおぜいのあらいぐまは、あの七面鳥たちのことを聞くとみんな大よろこびするけどね。
</J><E>
There's a plenty of other coons in these woods who'd be glad to know about those turkeys.
</E></T>
<T><J>
下手すると、『ありがとうございます！』なんてぼくにお礼まで言っちゃうよ」
</J><E>
And maybe they'd have the manners to say 'Thank you!' too." 
</E></T>
<T><J>
そしてカケスのジャスパーは、しわがれ声で意地わるく笑いながら飛び去っていきました。
</J><E>
And with a hoarse, sneering laugh Jasper Jay flew away.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
4 それだけ言われればふとっちょにはじゅうぶんでした。
</J><E>
That was enough for Fatty.
</E></T>
<T><J>
彼は決心しました。
</J><E>
He made up his mind
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょあらいぐまはこそんなことを恐れはしないと、カケスのジャスパーに知らしめてやろうと。
</J><E>
that he would show Jasper Jay that HE was not afraid.
</E></T>
<T><J>
それに、七面鳥を食べたくもありました。
</J><E>
And he wanted a turkey to eat, too.
</E></T>
<T><J>
お母さんにはジャスパーから聞いた話をだまっていました。
</J><E>
He said nothing to his mother about Jasper's news.
</E></T>
<T><J>
けれどその晩、月がのぼって月明かりが農夫のグリーンの家をくまなく照らすころ、ふとっちょあらいぐまは畑をしのび足で横切っていきました。
</J><E>
But that very night, when the moon came up, and the lights in Farmer Green's house were all out, Fatty Coon went stealing across the fields. 
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
5 ふとっちょは恐れてはいませんでした。
</J><E>
He was not afraid,
</E></T>
<T><J>
農夫のグリーンとその家族は全員ベッドに入っていることを知っていましたから。
</J><E>
for he knew that Farmer Green and all his family were in their beds.
</E></T>
<T><J>
あたりはひどく冷えこんでおり、農夫のグリーンの飼い犬たちは犬小屋に避難しているにちがいないと、ふとっちょは考えました。
</J><E>
And it was so cold that Fatty felt sure that Farmer Green's dogs would be inside their kennels.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
6 ふとっちょは物音を立てはしないつもりでした。
</J><E>
Fatty did not intend to make any noise.
</E></T>
<T><J>
七面鳥たちは眠っています
</J><E>
The turkeys were asleep
</E></T>
<T><J>
――カケスのジャスパーがそう言っていました
</J><E>
--so Jasper Jay had told him
</E></T>
<T><J>
――そのうちの一羽を、ほかの鳥たちに気づかれずにとてもすばやく静かにつかまえられるだろうと考えていました。
</J><E>
--and he expected to grab one of them so swiftly and silently that the other turkeys would never know it.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
7 農夫のグリーンの家の庭にくると、ふとっちょあらいぐまは枝をひろげたオークの木をなんなく見つけました。
</J><E>
When Fatty Coon came to Farmer Green's yard he had no trouble at all in finding the spreading oak.
</E></T>
<T><J>
その落葉した丸はだかの枝々いっぱいに七面鳥たちがとまり、まどろんでいるのが見えました。
</J><E>
He could see the turkeys plainly where they dozed on the bare branches.
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょは、言うよりもはやく木にのぼりました。
</J><E>
And in less time than it takes to tell it Fatty had climbed the tree.
</E></T>
<T><J>
一番ひくい枝に、四羽のふとった七面鳥がならんでとまり、そろってぐっすり眠っていました。
</J><E>
On the very lowest limb there was a row of four plump turkeys, all sound asleep.
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょは手をのばし、一番近くにいた鳥をつかみました。
</J><E>
And Fatty reached out and seized the nearest one.
</E></T>
<T><J>
鳥ののど元をつかんだので、この大きな鳥はさけび声を上げることができませんでした。
</J><E>
He seized the turkey by the neck, so that the big bird could not call out.
</E></T>
<T><J>
けれどふとっちょは、あまりすばやくありませんでした。 
</J><E>
But Fatty was not quite quick enough.
</E></T>
<T><J>
彼が鳥をこちらに引きよせる前に、鳥は羽根をばたつかせ始め、となりの鳥をたたきました。
</J><E>
Before he could pull her off her perch the turkey began to flap her wings, and she struck the turkey next her, 
</E></T>
<T><J>
それでその鳥が目をさまし、ガボガボ鳴いて羽根をばたつかせました。
</J><E>
so that THAT turkey woke up and began to gobble and flap HER wings. 
</E></T>
<T><J>
それから、そのとなりの枝にとまっていた鳥が目をさましました。
</J><E>
Then the next turkey on the limb woke up.
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょあらいぐまは初めて気づきました。
</J><E>
And the first thing that Fatty Coon knew,
</E></T>
<T><J>
のこりの三十九羽の七面鳥の一羽一羽それぞれが、ガボ、ガボ、ガボ、ガボ、ガボー！　と鳴き始めるんだってことをです！　
</J><E>
every one of the thirty-nine turkeys that were left was going gobble-gob-gob-gob-gobble!
</E></T>
<T><J>
そのうちの数羽が、庭の向こうへと舞いおりていきました。
</J><E>
And some of them went sailing off across the yard.
</E></T>
<T><J>
そのうちの一羽が、ちょうど農夫のグリーンの家の窓の外のポーチの上にとまりました。
</J><E>
One of them lighted on top of the porch just outside Farmer Green's window
</E></T>
<T><J>
どうやらふとっちょは、よりによって一番騒々しいさわぎを引き起こしてしまったようです。
</J><E>
and it seemed to Fatty that that one made the greatest racket of all.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
8 窓が引き上げられ、農夫のグリーンの声がしました。
</J><E>
Farmer Green's window flew up; and Farmer Green's voice called
</E></T>
<T><J>
「しずまれ！　
</J><E>
"Spot!
</E></T>
<T><J>
しずまれ！」
</J><E>
Spot!"
</E></T>
<T><J>
9 それを聞くと、ふとっちょあらいぐまはぐずぐずしませんでした。
</J><E>
Fatty Coon did not wait to hear anything more.
</E></T>
<T><J>
彼はつかんでいた七面鳥をほうり出し、地面に向かって木をすべり降りました。
</J><E>
He dropped the turkey he had seized and slipped down to the ground. 
</E></T>
<T><J>
それから、森に向かってあらんかぎりのはやさでかけ出しました。
</J><E>
And then he ran toward the woods as fast as he could go.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
10 そのとき、農夫のグリーンの飼い犬のスポットがほえました。
</J><E>
Farmer Green's dog Spot was barking now.
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょは道ばたの木に登りたいと思いました。
</J><E>
And Fatty wanted to climb one of the trees by the roadside.
</E></T>
<T><J>
ですが、彼は思い出しました。
</J><E>
But he remembered,
</E></T>
<T><J>
あの犬にとうもろこし畑のそばの木に追いつめられ、あやうい目にあったことがあったのでした。
</J><E>
the narrow escape he had had when the dog had treed him near the cornfield.
</E></T>
<T><J>
それで、森にたどり着くまで一度も止まらずに走りつづけました。
</J><E>
So he never stopped until he reached the woods.
</E></T>
<T><J>
そして、すばやく木にかけ登りました。
</J><E>
Then he went nimbly up into the trees.
</E></T>
<T><J>
スポットはふとっちょが最初に登った木の根元で立ち止まり、ほえ立てました。
</J><E>
And while Spot was barking at the foot of the first tree he climbed,
</E></T>
<T><J>
そのあいだ、ふとっちょは木のてっぺんからてっぺんへと移りながら家に向かいました。
</J><E>
Fatty was travelling through the tree-tops toward home.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
11 ふとっちょは、農夫のグリーンの七面鳥のことを決してお母さんに話しませんでした。
</J><E>
He never said anything to his mother about Farmer Green's turkeys.
</E></T>
<T><J>
けれど次にカケスのジャスパーに出会うと、彼のことをどう思っているのか、はっきり言ってやりました。
</J><E>
But the next time he saw Jasper Jay Fatty told him exactly what he thought of him.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
12 「アハハハ！」
</J><E>
"Ha! 
ha!" 
</E></T>
<T><J>
カケスのジャスパーはただ笑うだけでした。
</J><E>
Jasper Jay only laughed.
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょが大変な目にあったと聞いても、まるでおどろいていないようでした。
</J><E>
And he did not seem at all surprised that Fatty had fallen into trouble.
</E></T>
<T><J>
本当のことを言いますと、ジャスパーががっかりしたのただ一つ、ふとっちょが逃げおおせたことでした。
</J><E>
To tell the truth, he was only sorry because Fatty had escaped. 
</E></T>
<T><J>
カケスのジャスパーはふとっちょあらいぐまが嫌いでした。
</J><E>
Jasper Jay did not like Fatty Coon.
</E></T>
<T><J>
彼がふとっちょに四十羽の七面鳥のことを教えたのは、ふとっちょがそのうちの一羽を盗もうとしてつかまってしまえばいいと思ったからなのです。
</J><E>
And he had told him about the forty fat turkeys because he hoped that Fatty would get caught if he tried to steal one of them.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
13 「そのうちにお前をつかまえてやるからな！」
</J><E>
"Wait till I catch you!"
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょは言いました。
</J><E>
Fatty said.
</E></T>
<T><J>
14 けれどカケスのジャスパーは、ふとっちょがそう言ってやる前よりもいっそうけたたましい声で笑うだけでした。
</J><E>
But Jasper Jay only laughed harder than ever when Fatty said that.
</E></T>
<T><J>
ひどくおかしい冗談だと思っているようでした。
</J><E>
He seemed to think it was a great joke.
</E></T>
<T><J>
ジャスパーは、この上なくいらいらさせられるやつなのです。
</J><E>
He was most annoying.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>

<T><J>
ふとっちょ、うさぎのジミーに出会う
</J><E>
XIII
FATTY MEETS JIMMY RABBIT
</E></T>
<T><J>
1 ふとっちょあらいぐまは一度だけ、お腹が空いていなかったことがあります。
</J><E>
For once Fatty Coon was not hungry.
</E></T>
<T><J>
農夫のグリーンのとうもろこしをそれはたくさん食べて、もうあとひと口も飲みこめそうもないくらいになったときです。
</J><E>
He had eaten so much of Farmer Green's corn that he felt as if he could not swallow another mouthful.
</E></T>
<T><J>
森の中を家にむかってぶらぶら歩いていると、彼を呼ぶ者がありました。
</J><E>
He was strolling homewards through the woods when someone called to him.
</E></T>
<T><J>
うさぎのジミーです。
</J><E>
It was Jimmy Rabbit.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
2 「どこへ行くの、ふとっちょくん？」
</J><E>
"Where are you going, Fatty?" 
</E></T>
<T><J>
うさぎのジミーがたずねました。
</J><E>
Jimmy Rabbit asked.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
3 「家だよ！」
</J><E>
"Home!"
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょは言いました。
</J><E>
said Fatty.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
4 「お腹すいてる？」
</J><E>
"Are you hungry?"
</E></T>
<T><J>
うさぎのジミーは不安そうにたずねました。
</J><E>
Jimmy Rabbit asked anxiously.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
5 「すいてないと思うよ！」
</J><E>
"I should say not!"
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょは答えました。
</J><E>
Fatty answered.
</E></T>
<T><J>
「たった今ごはんを食べたとこなんだ。
生まれてはじめて食べた一番おいしいものだよ」
</J><E>
"I've just had the finest meal I ever ate in my life."
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
6 うさぎのジミーはそれを聞いて安心したようでした。
</J><E>
Jimmy Rabbit seemed to be relieved to hear that.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
7 「こっちでいっしょに遊ぼうよ」
</J><E>
"Come on over and play,"
</E></T>
<T><J>
ジミーは言いました。
</J><E>
he said.
</E></T>
<T><J>
「弟とぼくとで床屋さんごっこしてるんだよ。
</J><E>
"My brother and I are playing barber-shop 
</E></T>
<T><J>
古いスズカケの木のところで。
</J><E>
over in the old sycamore tree;
</E></T>
<T><J>
君がいないと始まらないんだよ」
</J><E>
and we need you."
</E></T>
<T><J>
8 「いいよ！」
</J><E>
"All right!" 
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょは言いました。
</J><E>
said Fatty.
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょと遊ぼうという森の小さな住民は、めったにいませんでした。
</J><E>
It was not often that any of the smaller forest-people were willing to play with him,
</E></T>
<T><J>
なぜなら、ふとっちょはたいていお腹がすくのを我慢できないし、するといつも遊び仲間を食べようとするからです。
</J><E>
because generally Fatty couldn't help getting hungry and then he usually tried to eat his playmates.
</E></T>
<T><J>
「ぼくがいないと始まらないって、なにをするの？」
</J><E>
"What do you need me for?"
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょは、うさぎのジミーとならんでてくてく歩きながらたずねました。
</J><E>
Fatty asked, as he trudged along beside Jimmy Rabbit.
</E></T>
<T><J>
9 「床屋の看板のあめんぼう柱に、君が必要なんだよ」
</J><E>
"We need you for the barber's pole,"
</E></T>
<T><J>
ジミーは説明しました。
</J><E>
Jimmy explained.
</E></T>
<T><J>
「君に木のうろの中に入って、穴からしっぽをつき出してもらいたいんだよ。
</J><E>
"You can come inside the hollow tree and stick your tail out through a hole.
</E></T>
<T><J>
それで立派な床屋のあめんぼう柱になるよ
</J><E>
It will make a fine barber's pole
</E></T>
<T><J>
――といっても、しまもようの色がちがってるんだけどさ、確かにね」
</J><E>
--though the stripes DO run the wrong way, to be sure."
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
10 ふとっちょあらいぐまはたいそうよろこびました。
</J><E>
Fatty Coon was greatly pleased.
</E></T>
<T><J>
彼はしっぽをつくづくとながめ、とてもほこらしい気分になりました。
</J><E>
He looked around at his tail and felt very proud.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
11 「ぼくのしっぽはきれいだろ？」
</J><E>
"I've got a beautiful tail--haven't I?" 
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょはたずねました。
</J><E>
he asked.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
12 「うーん、まあね！」
</J><E>
"Um--yes!"
</E></T>
<T><J>
うさぎのジミーは答えました。
</J><E>
Jimmy Rabbit replied,
</E></T>
<T><J>
「といっても、ぼくは自分のことを考えて、そんなことはないって言わないといけないんだけどね
</J><E>
"though I must say it isn't one that I would care for myself
</E></T>
<T><J>
……でもまあ、おいでよ！　
</J><E>
... But come along!
</E></T>
<T><J>
だれかが散髪してもらうのを待ってるかもしれないよ」
</J><E>
There may be people waiting to get their hair cut."
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
13 まあ、本当だ！　
</J><E>
Sure enough!
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふたりがごっこ遊びの床屋にたどりつくと、灰色リスが中におり、うさぎのジミーの弟が、リス氏の頭の毛をいそがしそうにチョッキンチョッキン切っているところでした。
</J><E>
When they reached the make-believe barber-shop there was a gray squirrel inside, and Jimmy Rabbit's brother was busily snipping the fur off Mr. Squirrel's head.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
14 「散髪代はいくらなの？」
</J><E>
"How much do you charge for a hair-cut?"
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょがたずねました。
</J><E>
Fatty asked.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
15 「ああ、お客しだいさ！」
</J><E>
"Oh, that depends!"
</E></T>
<T><J>
うさぎのジミーは答えました。
</J><E>
Jimmy Rabbit said.
</E></T>
<T><J>
「リス氏の頭はキャベツの葉っぱ六枚だ。
</J><E>
"Mr. Squirrel will pay us six cabbage leaves. 
</E></T>
<T><J>
でも、君の頭を刈るんなら、もっといただかないとね。
</J><E>
But if we were to cut your hair we'd have to ask more.
</E></T>
<T><J>
少なくとも、キャベツの葉っぱ十二枚はほしいね」
</J><E>
We'd want a dozen cabbage leaves, at least."
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
16 「じゃあ、ぼくはしっぽを使わせてやるんだから、ぼくだってなにかもらってもいいじゃないか？」
</J><E>
"Well, don't I get anything for the use of my tail?"
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょが言いました。
</J><E>
Fatty asked.
</E></T>
<T><J>
彼はすでにしっぽを穴からつき出しており、
</J><E>
He had already stuck it out through the hole; 
</E></T>
<T><J>
また引っ込めようかしらと思いました。
</J><E>
and he had half a mind to pull it in again.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
17 うさぎのジミーと弟は、しばらくの間ひそひそささやき合いました。
</J><E>
Jimmy Rabbit and his brother whispered together for a few moments.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
18 「どうするかっていうとね、」
</J><E>
"I'll tell you what we'll do," 
</E></T>
<T><J>
ジミーが言いました。
</J><E>
Jimmy said.
</E></T>
<T><J>
「君が床屋のあめんぼう柱にしっぽを使わせてくれるんなら、タダで君の頭を刈ってあげるよ。
</J><E>
"If you'll let us use your tail for the barber's pole, we'll cut your hair free.
</E></T>
<T><J>
それならじゅうぶんに公平だろ？」
</J><E>
Isn't that fair enough?"
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
19 ふとっちょあらいぐまは満足しました。
</J><E>
Fatty Coon was satisfied.
</E></T>
<T><J>
けれど、ジミーが彼の頭の毛を切り始めると、また言い出しました。
</J><E>
But he insisted that Jimmy begin to cut his hair at once.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
20 「ぼくは今、仕事中なんだよ」
</J><E>
"I'm doing my part of the work now,"
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょは指摘しました。
</J><E>
he pointed out.
</E></T>
<T><J>
「だから、君は君の仕事をしていてもいいんだよ」
</J><E>
"So there's no reason why you shouldn't do yours."
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
21 うさぎのジミーは、ふたたびふとっちょの頭の毛を切り始めました。
</J><E>
With that Jimmy Rabbit began.
</E></T>
<T><J>
彼はチョキチョキチョッキンとふとっちょの毛を切っては、時どき手を止めて出来具合を確かめました。
</J><E>
He clipped and snipped at Fatty's head, pausing now and then to see the effect.
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょの後ろにまわると、彼は一しゅん笑みを浮かべました。
</J><E>
He smiled once in a while, behind Fatty's back,
</E></T>
<T><J>
なぜなら、ふとっちょがこれを見たら、ぜったいに笑っちゃうからです。
</J><E>
because Fatty certainly did look funny 
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょの頭の毛は、どこもかしこもギザギザのでこぼこになっていました。
</J><E>
with his fur all ragged and uneven.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
22 「口ひげもいっとく？」
</J><E>
"Moustache trimmed?"
</E></T>
<T><J>
うさぎのジミーはふとっちょの頭の毛を切り終えると、たずねました。
</J><E>
Jimmy Rabbit asked, when he had finished with Fatty's head.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
23 「そりゃあ
</J><E>
"Certainly
</E></T>
<T><J>
……当たり前さ！」
</J><E>
--of course!"
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょあらいぐまは答えました。
</J><E>
Fatty Coon answered.
</E></T>
<T><J>
すぐさまふとっちょの長くて白い口ひげが、床屋の床にはらりと落ちました。
</J><E>
And pretty soon Fatty's long white moustache lay on the floor of the barber-shop.
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょは下を見おろし、美しい口ひげが足元に横たわっているのを見ると、ちょっぴり不安になりました。
</J><E>
Fatty felt a bit uneasy as he looked down and saw his beautiful moustache lying at his feet.
</E></T>
<T><J>
「あんまり短く切りすぎないでくれよ」
</J><E>
"You haven't cut it too short, I hope,"
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょは言いました。
</J><E>
he said.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
24 「もちさ！」
</J><E>
"No, indeed!" 
</E></T>
<T><J>
うさぎのジミーは自信満まんに言いました。
</J><E>
Jimmy Rabbit assured him.
</E></T>
<T><J>
「これって超はやりのスタイルなんだよ」
</J><E>
"It's the very latest style."
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
25 「いったい全体なにがあったんだい？」
</J><E>
"What on earth has happened to you?"
</E></T>
<T><J>
あらいぐま夫人がさけびました
</J><E>
Mrs. Coon cried,
</E></T>
<T><J>
――その夜、ふとっちょが家にもどったときのことです。
</J><E>
--when Fatty reached home that night.
</E></T>
<T><J>
「火の中にでもつっ込んだのかい？」
</J><E>
"Have you been in a fire?"
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
26 「これが超はやりなんだよ、お母さん」
</J><E>
"It's the latest style, Mother,"
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょは説明しました。
</J><E>
Fatty told her.
</E></T>
<T><J>
「少なくとも、うさぎのジミーによればそうらしいよ」
</J><E>
"At least, that's what Jimmy Rabbit says."
</E></T>
<T><J>
彼はふたたびほんのちょっぴり不安になりました。
</J><E>
He felt the least bit uneasy again.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
27 「うさぎのジミーにそれをやらせたのかい？」
</J><E>
"Did you let that Jimmy Rabbit do that to you?"
</E></T>
<T><J>
あらいぐま夫人はたずねました。
</J><E>
Mrs. Coon asked.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
28 ふとっちょははずかしさに頭をうなだれ、
</J><E>
Fatty hung his head.
</E></T>
<T><J>
だまり込みました。
</J><E>
He said nothing at all.
</E></T>
<T><J>
でもお母さんにはわかりました。
</J><E>
But his mother knew.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
29 「やれやれ！　
</J><E>
"Well!
</E></T>
<T><J>
いい笑いものだよ！」
</J><E>
you ARE a sight!"
</E></T>
<T><J>
お母さんは声だかに言いました。
</J><E>
she exclaimed.
</E></T>
<T><J>
「二、三か月もあれば、またわたしの子らしくなるだろう。
</J><E>
"It will be months before you look like my child again.
</E></T>
<T><J>
お前を連れて外を出歩くのがはずかしいよ」
</J><E>
I shall be ashamed to go anywhere with you."
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
30 ふとっちょあらいぐまは、ひどいかつがれ方をしたと思いました。
</J><E>
Fatty Coon felt very foolish.
</E></T>
<T><J>
泣くのをこらえるのがせいいっぱいでした。
</J><E>
And there was just one thing that kept him from crying.
</E></T>
<T><J>
この借りは返さなくてはなりません。
</J><E>
And THAT was THIS:
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょは決心しました。
</J><E>
he made up his mind
</E></T>
<T><J>
うさぎのジミーとふたたび床屋さんごっこをし、仕返しをしてやろうと。
</J><E>
that when he played barber-shop with Jimmy Rabbit again he would get even with him.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
31 しかし翌日、うさぎのジミーとその弟はどこにもいませんでした。
</J><E>
But when the next day came, Fatty couldn't find Jimmy Rabbit and his brother anywhere.
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふたりは姿をくらましていました。
</J><E>
They kept out of sight.
</E></T>
<T><J>
けれど、ふたりは森の住民すべてにふとっちょあらいぐまにいたずらをした話を言いふらしており、森の住民たちはふとっちょをからかいました。
</J><E>
But they had told all the other forest-people about the trick they had played on Fatty Coon. 
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょはどこにいこうと、ホーホーとやじられ、あざけられ、笑われてばかりいました。
</J><E>
And everywhere Fatty went he heard nothing but hoots and jeers and laughs.
</E></T>
<T><J>
彼はひどくばかにされたと思いました。
</J><E>
He felt very silly.
</E></T>
<T><J>
そして、うさぎのジミーとその弟に会えないだろうかとねがいました。
</J><E>
And he wished that he might meet Jimmy Rabbit and his brother.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
床屋さんごっこ、ふたたび
</J><E>
XIV
THE BARBER-SHOP AGAIN
</E></T>
<T><J>
1 ふとっちょあらいぐまがうさぎのジミーとその弟をつかまえ、またいっしょに床屋さんごっこをするなど、決してできませんでした。
</J><E>
Although Fatty Coon never could get Jimmy Rabbit and his brother to play barber-shop with him again, 
</E></T>
<T><J>
それなのにふとっちょは、彼らぬきでこの遊びをするなんて考えられませんでした。
</J><E>
Fatty saw no reason why he should not play the game without them.
</E></T>
<T><J>
それである日、弟の黒っちょをつれてうろの空いた古いスズカケの木へ出かけました。
</J><E>
So one day he led his brother Blackie over to the old hollow sycamore.
</E></T>
<T><J>
妹のふわっちょとかわいっちょも、いっしょに行きたがりました。
</J><E>
His sisters, Fluffy and Cutey, wanted to go too.
</E></T>
<T><J>
けれどふとっちょは、ふたりをつれて行きませんでした。
</J><E>
But Fatty would not let them.
</E></T>
<T><J>
「女の子は床屋さんになれないんだよ」
</J><E>
"Girls can't be barbers,"
</E></T>
<T><J>
と、ふとっちょは言いました。
</J><E>
he said.
</E></T>
<T><J>
もちろん、ふたりはそれに言いかえすことができませんでした。
</J><E>
And of course they could find no answer to that.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
2 こんなことを申し上げるのは残念なのですが、ふとっちょと黒っちょはスズカケの古木にたどり着くやいなや、口げんかを始めました。
</J><E>
As soon as Fatty and Blackie reached the old sycamore I am sorry to say that a dispute arose.
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふたりとも、自分のしっぽを床屋のあめんぼう柱の看板にしたがったのです。
</J><E>
Each of them wanted to use his own tail for the barber's pole.
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふたりそろって一緒にしっぽを木の穴からつき出すなんてできません。
</J><E>
They couldn't both stick their tails through the hole in the tree at the same time.
</E></T>
<T><J>
それでとうとう、順番こにしっぽを出すことで決着しました。
</J><E>
So they finally agreed to take turns.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
3 床屋さんごっこは、ふたりが考えていたようには楽しくありませんでした。
</J><E>
Playing barber-shop wasn't so much fun as they had expected, 
</E></T>
<T><J>
なぜなら、散髪してもらいに近づいてくる者なんてだれもいませんでしたから。
</J><E>
because nobody would come near to get his hair cut. 
</E></T>
<T><J>
だってね、森の小さな住民たちはみな恐がって、ふとっちょと黒っちょがいるスズカケの古木の中になんて入ってきませんものね。
</J><E>
You see, the smaller forest-people were all afraid to go inside that old sycamore where Fatty and Blackie were.
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふたりの兄弟がとてもお腹がすいたときに、うさぎや灰色リスやシマリスをつかまえて、食べてしまうかもわかりません。
</J><E>
There was no telling when the two brothers might get so hungry they would seize and eat a rabbit or a squirrel or a chipmunk.
</E></T>
<T><J>
そんな危険をおかすなんておろかなことだというのは、よくおわかりでしょう。
</J><E>
And you know it isn't wise to run any such risk as that.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
4 ふとっちょが、黒っちょの頭の毛を切ってやろうと申し出ました。
</J><E>
Fatty offered to cut Blackie's hair.
</E></T>
<T><J>
けれど黒っちょは、ふとっちょが頭の毛をどこもかしこもギザギザのでこぼこにし、口ひげをなくして家に帰ってきたとき、お母さんがなんと言ったのかを思い出しました。
</J><E>
But Blackie remembered what his mother had said when Fatty came home with his moustache gone and his head all rough and uneven.
</E></T>
<T><J>
それで黒っちょは、ふとっちょに頭の毛をさわらせませんでした。
</J><E>
So Blackie wouldn't let Fatty touch him. 
</E></T>
<T><J>
けれど彼は、ふとっちょの頭の毛を切ってやろうと申し出ました
</J><E>
But HE offered to cut Fatty's hair
</E></T>
<T><J>
――それは黒っちょが困ることではありませんもの。
</J><E>
--what there was left of it.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
5 「えんりょするよ！」
</J><E>
"No, thank you!"
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょは言いました。
</J><E>
said Fatty.
</E></T>
<T><J>
「ぼくは頭の毛を切るの、ひと月にいっぺんだけにしてるんだ」
</J><E>
"I only get my hair cut once a month."
</E></T>
<T><J>
もちろん彼が頭の毛を切ったのは、全生涯のうちであの一度きりでした。
</J><E>
Of course, he had never had his hair cut except that once, in his whole life.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
6 さて、木のうろの中にいてもすることなんてほとんどありませんでしたから、ふとっちょと黒っちょはけんかをし続けていました。
</J><E>
Now, since there was so little to do inside the hollow tree, Fatty and Blackie kept quarreling.
</E></T>
<T><J>
黒っちょが木の壁の穴へしっぽを入れるがはやいか、ふとっちょが自分の番だとせっつきます。
</J><E>
Blackie would no sooner stick his tail through the hole in the side of the tree than Fatty would want HIS turn.
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょが穴へしっぽをねじ込みますと、黒っちょがふとっちょの番はもう終わったと言いはります。
</J><E>
And when Fatty had succeeded in squeezing HIS tail out through the opening Blackie would insist that Fatty's time was up.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
7 ふとっちょの番になると、はやくどいて番をゆずれと黒っちょがどなりました。
</J><E>
It was Fatty's turn, and Blackie was shouting to him to stand aside and give him a chance.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
8 「やーだね！」
</J><E>
"I won't!" 
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょが言いました。
</J><E>
said Fatty.
</E></T>
<T><J>
「ぼくは満足するまでいつまででもここにいるんだ」
</J><E>
"I'm going to stay here just as long as I please."
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
9 ふとっちょの口からその言葉が出ることはありませんでした。
</J><E>
The words were hardly out of his mouth 
</E></T>
<T><J>
その代わりに彼の口から出たのは、するどい金きり声でした。
</J><E>
when he gave a sharp squeal, 
</E></T>
<T><J>
まるでなにかに痛めつけられたような声です。
</J><E>
as if something hurt him.
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょは穴からしっぽを引きぬこうとしました。
</J><E>
And he tried to pull his tail out of the hole.
</E></T>
<T><J>
今ではそうしたくなっていました。
</J><E>
He wanted to get it out now.
</E></T>
<T><J>
けれど、ああ！　
</J><E>
But alas!
</E></T>
<T><J>
しっぽを引きぬくことができません！　
</J><E>
it would not come!
</E></T>
<T><J>
なにかにしっぽをがっちりつかまえられていたのです！　
</J><E>
It was caught fast!
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょがしっぽを強く引けばひくほど、それはますます痛くしっぽをつかみました。
</J><E>
And the harder Fatty pulled the more it hurt him.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
10 「外に行って、いったいどうなっているのか見てきてよ！」
</J><E>
"Go out and see what's the matter!" 
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょは黒っちょに向かってさけびました。
</J><E>
he cried to Blackie.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
11 けれど黒っちょは身動きしませんでした。
</J><E>
But Blackie wouldn't stir.
</E></T>
<T><J>
安全な木のうろの外に出るのが恐かったのです。
</J><E>
He was afraid to leave the shelter of the hollow tree.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
12 「クマにしっぽをつかまえられているのかもしれないよ」
</J><E>
"It may be a bear that has hold of your tail," 
</E></T>
<T><J>
黒っちょはふとっちょにいいました。
</J><E>
he told Fatty.
</E></T>
<T><J>
その考えに、ふとっちょはおのずと全身がふるえあがりました。
</J><E>
And somehow, that idea made Fatty tremble all over.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
13 「ああ、そんな！　
</J><E>
"Oh, dear!
</E></T>
<T><J>
そんなあ！」
</J><E>
oh, dear!"
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょは泣き声をあげました。
</J><E>
he wailed.
</E></T>
<T><J>
「どうしたらいいの？　
</J><E>
"What shall I do?
</E></T>
<T><J>
いったいどうしたらいいの？」
</J><E>
Oh! 
whatever shall I do?"
</E></T>
<T><J>
そして泣き始めました。
</J><E>
He began to cry.
</E></T>
<T><J>
黒っちょもいっしょに泣き出しました。
</J><E>
And Blackie cried too.
</E></T>
<T><J>
ここにお母さんがいて、どうしたらいいのか教えてくれたらどんなにいいだろう、とふとっちょは思いました。
</J><E>
How Fatty wished that his mother was there to tell him what to do!
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
14 でもふとっちょは、お母さんを呼んでくることなどできないのはわかっていました。
</J><E>
But he knew of no way to fetch her.
</E></T>
<T><J>
もしもお母さんがお家にいたとしても、この木の中でさけんだって、お母さんには決して聞こえないのです。
</J><E>
Even if she were at home she could never hear him calling from inside the tree.
</E></T>
<T><J>
それでふとっちょは、お母さんに助けを求めるという望みをすっかりあきらめました。
</J><E>
So Fatty gave up all hope of her helping.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
15 「どうかお願いしますクマさん、しっぽを放してください！」
</J><E>
"Please, Mr. Bear, let go of my tail!"
</E></T>
<T><J>
しっぽをぎりぎりつかまれる痛みにたえ切れなくなり、ふとっちょはさけびました。
</J><E>
he cried, when he could stand the pain no longer.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
16 返ってきた返事は、低いうなり声だけでした。
</J><E>
The only answer that came was a low growl,
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょと黒っちょは前にもましてふるえあがりました。
</J><E>
which frightened Fatty and Blackie more than ever.
</E></T>
<T><J>
そうして、ふたりの泣きさけぶ声が最高潮にたかまったちょうどそのとき、突然つかまえられていたふとっちょのしっぽが自由になりました。
</J><E>
And then, just as they both began to howl at the top of their voices Fatty's tail was suddenly freed.
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょはしっぽを思いきり強く引っぱっていたので、床屋の床の上にどうとたおれ込みました。
</J><E>
He was pulling on it so hard that he fell all in a heap on the floor of the barber-shop.
</E></T>
<T><J>
彼はびっくりしました。
</J><E>
And that surprised him.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
17 けれど、お母さんの声が聞こえたときには、ますますびっくりしました――
</J><E>
But he was still more surprised when he heard his mother say--
</E></T>
<T><J>
18 「泣くのを止めて出ておいで
</J><E>
"Stop crying and come out
</E></T>
<T><J>
――ふたりとも！」
</J><E>
--both of you!"
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょと黒っちょは、スズカケの木のうろの中からいそいで飛び出しました。
</J><E>
Fatty and Blackie scrambled out of the hollow sycamore.
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょは辺りを見回しました。
</J><E>
Fatty looked all around.
</E></T>
<T><J>
けれど、クマの姿はどこにも見当たりませんでした
</J><E>
But there was no bear to be seen anywhere
</E></T>
<T><J>
――お母さんがいるだけです。
</J><E>
--no one but his mother.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
19 「クマを追っ払っちゃったの、お母さん？」
</J><E>
"Did you frighten the bear away, Mother?"
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょはたずねました。
</J><E>
he asked.
</E></T>
<T><J>
20 「クマなんかいやしなかったよ」
</J><E>
"There was no bear,"
</E></T>
<T><J>
あらいぐま夫人はふとっちょに言いました。
</J><E>
Mrs. Coon told him.
</E></T>
<T><J>
「いなくて運がよかった。
</J><E>
"And it's lucky for you that there wasn't.
</E></T>
<T><J>
この木からお前のしっぽがつき出しているのが見えたんで、教えてやろうと思ったのさ。
</J><E>
I saw your tail sticking out of this tree and I thought I would teach you a lesson.
</E></T>
<T><J>
さあ、これからはもう、こんな馬鹿なまねはするんじゃないよ。
</J><E>
Now, don't ever do such a foolish thing again.
</E></T>
<T><J>
通りかかったのがジョニー・グリーンだったらどうなっていたのか、よく考えて肝にめいじておくんだよ。
</J><E>
Just think what a fix you would have been in if Johnnie Green had come along.
</E></T>
<T><J>
こんなふうに、わけなくあっさりとつかまってしまうんだからね」
</J><E>
He could have caught you just as easily as anything."
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
21 ふとっちょあらいぐまはふたたび自由になれたことをよろこび、今後は決してこのようなことはしないと、しっかりと約束しました。
</J><E>
Fatty Coon was so glad to be free once more that he promised to be good forever after.
</E></T>
<T><J>
そして、幼いアライグマができるかぎりそのとおりにして
</J><E>
And he was just as good as any little coon could be
</E></T>
<T><J>
――残りの人生の日々を無事にすごしたのでした。
</J><E>
--all the rest of that day.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょ、くんせい小屋に入る
</J><E>
XV
FATTY VISITS THE SMOKE-HOUSE
</E></T>
<T><J>
1 冬がかけ足でやって来ました。
</J><E>
The winter was fast going.
</E></T>
<T><J>
二月のある晴れた日、ふとっちょあらいぐまはひなたぼっこのあたたかさを楽しもうと、お母さんの家からはい出しました
</J><E>
And one fine day in February Fatty Coon crept out of his mother's house to enjoy the warm sunshine
</E></T>
<T><J>
――それから、食べ物をさがそうとして。
</J><E>
--and see what he could find to eat.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
2 秋からくらべると、ふとっちょはずいぶんとやせ細っていました。
</J><E>
Fatty was much thinner than he had been in the fall.
</E></T>
<T><J>
たいそう多くの時間を眠ってすごし、じつにほんのわずかしか食べていなかったのです。
</J><E>
He had spent so much of the time sleeping that he had really eaten very little.
</E></T>
<T><J>
今のふとっちょは、わき腹を見ると、われながらとても自分だとは思えませんでした。
</J><E>
And now he hardly knew himself as he looked at his sides.
</E></T>
<T><J>
もはやかつてのように出っぱっていませんでした。
</J><E>
They no longer stuck out as they had once.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
3 午後じゅうかかって沼や森をかぎ回ったすえ、この辺りでごはんを手に入れようとするのは無駄なことだととうとうあきらめました。
</J><E>
After nosing about the swamp and the woods all the afternoon Fatty decided that there was no use in trying to get a meal there.
</E></T>
<T><J>
地面は雪でおおわれていました。
</J><E>
The ground was covered with snow.
</E></T>
<T><J>
うさぎの足あと以外は
</J><E>
And except for rabbit tracks
</E></T>
<T><J>
――そして数匹のリスのものと
</J><E>
--and a few squirrels'
</E></T>
<T><J>
――食べ物のありかを示すものはなにも見つけられませんでした。
</J><E>
--he could find nothing that even suggestaed food.
</E></T>
<T><J>
そんな足あとを見ると、ますますお腹がすいてしまうだけでした。
</J><E>
And looking at those tracks only made him hungrier than ever.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
4 しばらくの間、ふとっちょはじっくりと考えました。
</J><E>
For a few minutes Fatty thought deeply.
</E></T>
<T><J>
そして彼はくるりと向きをかえ、農夫のグリーンの家のほうにまっすぐに歩いていきました。
</J><E>
And then he turned about and went straight toward Farmer Green's place.
</E></T>
<T><J>
農夫のグリーンの家をかこう柵のかげで、ふとっちょは待ちました。
</J><E>
He waited behind the fence just beyond Farmer Green's house;
</E></T>
<T><J>
そして暗くなり始めると、庭をこっそりと横ぎっていきました。
</J><E>
and when it began to grow dark he crept across the barnyard.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
5 丈の低い、小さな建物のそばを通りかかったところで、ふとっちょはおいしそうなにおいに気がつき、
</J><E>
As Fatty passed a small, low building he noticed a delicious smell.
</E></T>
<T><J>
ぴたりと足を止めました。
</J><E>
And he stopped right there.
</E></T>
<T><J>
彼はじゅうぶんすぎるほど弱りきっていました。
</J><E>
He had gone far enough.
</E></T>
<T><J>
建物のとびらがほんの少し開いていました。
</J><E>
The door was open a little way.
</E></T>
<T><J>
辺りをすばやく一べつしたのち
</J><E>
And after one quick look all around
</E></T>
<T><J>
――確かにだれもいないようにふとっちょは思いました
</J><E>
--to make sure there was nobody to see him
</E></T>
<T><J>
――中にすべり込みました。
</J><E>
--Fatty slipped inside.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
6 農夫のグリーンのくんせい小屋の中は
</J><E>
It was almost dark inside Farmer Green's smokehouse
</E></T>
<T><J>
――この丈の低い、小さな建物は、そう呼ばれていました
</J><E>
--for that was what the small, low building was called.
</E></T>
<T><J>
――ほとんど真っ暗でした。
</J><E>
It was almost dark;
</E></T>
<T><J>
ですがふとっちょは、わたしやみなさんが昼なかに見るのと同じくらいに、真っ暗がりがよく見えました。
</J><E>
but Fatty could see just as well as you and I can see in the daytime.
</E></T>
<T><J>
そこにはハムがきちんと長い一列にならべられて、ずらりとぶら下がっていました。
</J><E>
There was a long row of hams hung up in a line.
</E></T>
<T><J>
その足もとの地面には白い灰がありました。
</J><E>
Underneath them were white ashes, 
</E></T>
<T><J>
農夫のグリーンがハムをいぶすのに火をおこしたあとでした。
</J><E>
where Farmer Green had built wood fires, to smoke the hams.
</E></T>
<T><J>
ですが今は火は消えており、
</J><E>
But the fires were out, now;
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょがやけどをする心配はありませんでした。
</J><E>
and Fatty was in no danger of being burned.
</E></T>
<T><J>
7 ふとっちょあらいぐまは、前にもハムのにおいをかいだことがありました。
</J><E>
The hams were what Fatty Coon had smelled.
</E></T>
<T><J>
ハムはふとっちょがいつか食べてやろうと考えていたものでした。
</J><E>
And the hams were what Fatty intended to eat.
</E></T>
<T><J>
彼は、ここにあるハムを全部たいらげてやろうと決心しました
</J><E>
He decided that he would eat them all
</E></T>
<T><J>
――もちろん、そんなことは絶対にできっこありません
</J><E>
--though of course he could never have done that
</E></T>
<T><J>
――少なくとも、一晩では無理です。
</J><E>
--at least, not in one night;
</E></T>
<T><J>
一週間でもだめです。
</J><E>
nor in a week, either. 
</E></T>
<T><J>
けれども食べるときがくれば、ふとっちょは決してひるまないのです。
</J><E>
But when it came to eating, Fatty's courage never failed him.
</E></T>
<T><J>
もしもそんな機会があれば、彼はゾウだって食べようとするでしょう。
</J><E>
He would have tried to eat an elephant, if he had had the chance.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
8 ふとっちょはハムの列をながめて立ちつくしていたりしませんでした。
</J><E>
Fatty did not stop to look long at that row of hams. 
</E></T>
<T><J>
小屋のすみの柱をかけ上り、ハムをつるした横棒をつたっていきました。
</J><E>
He climbed a post that ran up the side of the house and he crept out along the pole from which the hams were hung.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
9 一番こちらがわにあるハムのところにたどり着くと、ふとっちょは立ち止まりました。
</J><E>
He stopped at the very first ham he came to.
</E></T>
<T><J>
これ以上考えることなんてありません。
</J><E>
There was no sense in going any further.
</E></T>
<T><J>
ハムの上に下り立つと、またたく間においしいひと口を大きく噛みちぎりました。
</J><E>
And Fatty dropped on top of the ham and in a twinkling he had torn off a big, delicious mouthful.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
10 ふとっちょは満足にしっかりと食べることができませんでした。
</J><E>
Fatty could not eat fast enough. 
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふた口目を食べたかったのですが
</J><E>
He wished he had two mouths
</E></T>
<T><J>
――とてもお腹がすいていましたので。
</J><E>
--he was so hungry.
</E></T>
<T><J>
けれどもしっかりと食べられたのは、たったのひと口だけでした。
</J><E>
But he did very well, with only ONE.
</E></T>
<T><J>
彼はハムにたちまちのうちに大穴をあけました。
</J><E>
In no time at all he had made a great hole in the ham.
</E></T>
<T><J>
食べるのを止めようなんて考えてはいませんでした。
</J><E>
And he had no idea of stopping.
</E></T>
<T><J>
けれど止めました。
</J><E>
But he did stop.
</E></T>
<T><J>
ひどく唐突に止めました。
</J><E>
He stopped very suddenly.
</E></T>
<T><J>
はじめ彼が思ったのは、なにかに床に投げ落とされたということでした。
</J><E>
For the first thing he knew, something threw him right down upon the floor.
</E></T>
<T><J>
それから、ハムが彼のお腹の上に落ちてきたので、あやうく失神しかけました。
</J><E>
And the ham fell on top of him and nearly knocked him senseless.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
11 ふとっちょはむせてせき込みました。
</J><E>
He choked and spluttered;
</E></T>
<T><J>
灰が口や目や耳にまでいっぱい入ってしまったのです。
</J><E>
for the ashes filled his mouth and his eyes, and his ears, too.
</E></T>
<T><J>
しばらくの間、彼はあお向けにひっくり返っていました。
</J><E>
For a moment he lay there on his back;
</E></T>
<T><J>
しかしすぐさまお腹の上の重たいハムをなんとか蹴りのけ、少し正気を取りもどしました。
</J><E>
but soon he managed to kick the heavy ham off his stomach and then he felt a little better.
</E></T>
<T><J>
けれども、彼はひどくおびえていました。
</J><E>
But he was terribly frightened. 
</E></T>
<T><J>
目がずきずきと痛んでよく見えなかったというのに、飛び起きてとびらを見つけ、かけ抜けました。
</J><E>
And though his eyes smarted so he could hardly see, he sprang up and found the doorway.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
12 内庭をいちもくさんにかけ抜ける間に、ふとっちょは口一杯に灰を吸い込んでしまいました。
</J><E>
Fatty swallowed a whole mouthful of ashes as he dashed across the barnyard. 
</E></T>
<T><J>
家が見えるまで、一度も走る足を止めませんでした。
</J><E>
And he never stopped running until he was almost home.
</E></T>
<T><J>
彼は混乱していました。
</J><E>
He was puzzled.
</E></T>
<T><J>
なにに床に投げ落とされたのか、考えてみましたがわかりませんでした。
</J><E>
Try as he would, he couldn't decide what it was that had flung him upon the floor.
</E></T>
<T><J>
お母さんにこの冒険のことを話しますと
</J><E>
And when he told his mother about his adventure
</E></T>
<T><J>
――まる一か月後のことでしたが
</J><E>
--as he did a whole month later
</E></T>
<T><J>
――彼女にも、なにが起きたのかはっきりとはわかりませんでした。
</J><E>
--she didn't know exactly what had happened, either.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
13 「わなの一しゅだったのかもしれないね」
</J><E>
"It was some sort of trap, probably," 
</E></T>
<T><J>
とあらいぐま夫人は言いました。
</J><E>
Mrs. Coon said.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
14 けれどあらいぐま夫人はまたまた間違っていました。
</J><E>
But for once Mrs. Coon was mistaken.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
15 じつに単純なことでした。
</J><E>
It was very simple.
</E></T>
<T><J>
食い意地がはってあせったふとっちょは、横棒につるしたハムをゆわえたひもを食いちぎってしまっただけだったのでした。
</J><E>
In his greedy haste Fatty had merely bitten through the cord that fastened the ham to the pole.
</E></T>
<T><J>
当然ながら、ハムはたちまち落っこち、上に乗っていたふとっちょも一緒に落っこちたのでした！
</J><E>
And of course it had at once fallen, carrying Fatty with it!
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
18 けれど、みなさんはこれをどう思います？　
</J><E>
But what do you suppose?
</E></T>
<T><J>
のちにふとっちょが大人になり、子どもを持つと、農夫のグリーンのくんせい小屋のわなから脱け出したときのことを、しばしば子どもたちに語ってきかせました。
</J><E>
Afterward, when Fatty had grown up, and had children of his own, he often told them about the time he had escaped from the trap in Farmer Green's smokehouse.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
17 ふとっちょの子どもたちは、このお話にたいそう興奮しました。
</J><E>
Fatty's children thought it very exciting.
</E></T>
<T><J>
彼らのお気に入りのお話でした。
</J><E>
It was their favorite story.
</E></T>
<T><J>
そして、何度も何度もくり返しねだって、父親にお話させたのでした。
</J><E>
And they made their father tell it over and over again.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょ、どろぼうになる
</J><E>
XVI
FATTY COON PLAYS ROBBER
</E></T>
<T><J>
1 うさぎのジミーとその弟といっしょに床屋さんごっこをして以来、ふとっちょあらいぐまは長いあいだふたりに出会えませんでした。
</J><E>
After Fatty Coon played barber-shop with Jimmy Rabbit and his brother it was a long time before he met them again.
</E></T>
<T><J>
ところがある日、森の中をぶらぶら歩いているときに、ジミーの姿を見つけました。
</J><E>
But one day Fatty was wandering through the woods when he caught sight of Jimmy.
</E></T>
<T><J>
ジミーは木のかげにひらりと身をかくしました。
</J><E>
Jimmy dodged behind a tree.
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょは、ジミーの弟がべつの木のかげからこちらをぬすみ見ているのに気づきました。
</J><E>
And Fatty saw Jimmy's brother peep from behind another.
</E></T>
<T><J>
だってね、弟の耳はとっても長いでしょう。
</J><E>
You see, his ears were so long 
</E></T>
<T><J>
二本の耳が木のかげからにょっきりつき出ていて、ふとっちょが気づかないわけにいかなかったのですよ。
</J><E>
that they stuck far beyond the tree, and Fatty couldn't help seeing them.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
2 「やあ！」
</J><E>
"Hello!" 
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょは声をかけました。
</J><E>
Fatty called.
</E></T>
<T><J>
「会えてうれしいよ」
</J><E>
"I'm glad to see you."
</E></T>
<T><J>
それは本心でもありました。
</J><E>
And he told the truth, too.
</E></T>
<T><J>
数週間のあいだふたりの兄弟を探しつづけてきたのは、仕返しにふたりの口ひげをちょん切ってやりたかったからなのですから。
</J><E>
He had been trying to find those two brothers for weeks, because he wanted to get even with them for cutting off his moustache.
</E></T>
<T><J>
ジミーとその弟は、それぞれの木のかげからぴょんと飛び出しました。
</J><E>
Jimmy and his brother hopped out from behind their trees.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
3 「やあ！」
</J><E>
"Hello!" 
</E></T>
<T><J>
ジミーが言いました。
</J><E>
said Jimmy.
</E></T>
<T><J>
「ちょうど君を見つけようとしていたんだよ」
</J><E>
"We were just looking for you." 
</E></T>
<T><J>
たぶん、ジミーはこう言いたかったんでしょう。
</J><E>
Probably he meant to say,
</E></T>
<T><J>
「ちょうど君から見つからないようにしていたんだよ」
</J><E>
"We were just looking AT you."
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょと出会ってしまい、ジミーは少々うろたえていました。
</J><E>
He was somewhat upset by meeting Fatty;
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょが自分のしたことに腹を立てているのを知っていましたから。
</J><E>
for he knew that Fatty was angry with him.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
4 「へーえ！　
</J><E>
"Oh, ho!
</E></T>
<T><J>
ぼくを見つけようとしていたって？」
</J><E>
You were, were you?"
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょは言いました。
</J><E>
Fatty answered.
</E></T>
<T><J>
彼は上りかけていた木をそろそろと下り始めました。
</J><E>
He began to slide down the tree he had been climbing.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
5 うさぎのジミーと弟は、じりじりと後ずさりしました。
</J><E>
Jimmy Rabbit and his brother edged a little further away.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
6 「ぼくらにあんまり近づかないほうがいいよ！」
</J><E>
"Better not come too near us!"
</E></T>
<T><J>
ジミーが言いました。
</J><E>
he said.
</E></T>
<T><J>
「ぼくらふたりとも結膜炎なんだ。
</J><E>
"We've both got the pink-eye,
</E></T>
<T><J>
近づくと君にもうつっちゃうぞ」
</J><E>
and you don't want to catch it."
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
7 ふとっちょは立ち止まり、兄弟をよく見ました。
</J><E>
Fatty paused and looked at the brothers.
</E></T>
<T><J>
まあ、本当だ！　
</J><E>
Sure enough!
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふたりの目は、ひどい赤色でした。
</J><E>
their eyes were as pink as anything.
</E></T>
<T><J>
8 「目になにかが入ったの？」
</J><E>
"Does it hurt much?"
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょはたずねました。
</J><E>
Fatty asked.
</E></T>
<T><J>
9 「うーん
</J><E>
"Well
</E></T>
<T><J>
……そうでもあるし、そうでもないよ」
</J><E>
--it does and it doesn't,"
</E></T>
<T><J>
ジミーは答えました。
</J><E>
Jimmy replied.
</E></T>
<T><J>
「ほんの少し前に、片いっぽうの目にイバラのトゲが目に入ってすごく痛かったんだ。
</J><E>
"I just stuck a brier into one of my eyes a few minutes ago and it hurt awful, then.
</E></T>
<T><J>
でも、君はぜんぜん大丈夫だよ。
</J><E>
But you'll be perfectly safe, 
</E></T>
<T><J>
ぼくらにさわりさえしなければね」
</J><E>
so long as you don't touch us."
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
10 「どれくらいで治るの？」
</J><E>
"How long does it last?"
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょがたずねました。
</J><E>
Fatty inquired.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
11 「たぶん絶対に治らないよ」
</J><E>
"Probably we'll never get over it,"
</E></T>
<T><J>
うさぎのジミーはうれしそうに言いました。
</J><E>
Jimmy Rabbit said cheerfully. 
</E></T>
<T><J>
弟も、力強くうなづきながら言いました。
</J><E>
And his brother nodded his head, as much as to say,
</E></T>
<T><J>
「絶対にそうさ！」
</J><E>
"That's so!"
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
12 ふとっちょあらいぐまはほんのちょっぴり警戒しました。
</J><E>
Fatty Coon was just the least bit alarmed.
</E></T>
<T><J>
彼は、ふたりの目がどうかしてしまったのかしらと本気で心配しました。
</J><E>
He really thought that there was something the matter with their eyes.
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふたりの兄弟はうさぎですから、目はたいていいつも真っ赤っかでしょう
</J><E>
You see, though the Rabbit brothers' eyes were always pink 
</E></T>
<T><J>
（うさぎは生まれつきそうなのです）。
</J><E>
(for they were born that way),
</E></T>
<T><J>
それなのにね、ふとっちょはこれまでそのことにちっとも気づかなかったのですよ。
</J><E>
he had never noticed it before.
</E></T>
<T><J>
ですから、ふとっちょはふたりにあんまり近づかないようにすれば大丈夫なのだろうと思ってしまいました。
</J><E>
So Fatty thought it would be safer not to go too near them.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
13 「そっか、それは残念だな」
</J><E>
"Well, it's too bad,"
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょはジミーに言いました。
</J><E>
he told Jimmy.
</E></T>
<T><J>
「君たちと遊びたかったんだけど、がっかりだよ」
</J><E>
"I'm sorry. 
I wanted to play with you."
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
14 「ああ、それならいいよ！」
</J><E>
"Oh, that's all right!" 
</E></T>
<T><J>
ジミーが言いました。
</J><E>
Jimmy said.
</E></T>
<T><J>
「前みたいに遊べるよ。
</J><E>
"We can play, just the same.
</E></T>
<T><J>
どうやって遊ぶのか教えてあげる。
</J><E>
I'll tell you what we'll play.
</E></T>
<T><J>
あのね――」
</J><E>
We'll play--"
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
15 「床屋さんごっこはだめだよ！」
</J><E>
"Not barber-shop!"
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょがさえぎりました。
</J><E>
Fatty interrupted.
</E></T>
<T><J>
「床屋さんごっこはしないぞ。
</J><E>
"I won't play barber-shop,
</E></T>
<T><J>
あの遊びは大っきらいだ」
</J><E>
I never liked that game."
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
16 うさぎのジミーは笑い始めました。
</J><E>
Jimmy Rabbit started to smile.
</E></T>
<T><J>
けれど、笑いをくしゃみでごまかしました。
</J><E>
But he turned his smile into a sneeze.
</E></T>
<T><J>
それから、ジミーは言いました――
</J><E>
And he said--
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
17 「どろぼうごっこをするんだよ。
</J><E>
"We'll play robber.
</E></T>
<T><J>
君はきっと気に入るよ。
</J><E>
You'll like that, I know.
</E></T>
<T><J>
君はどろぼう役にぴったりだしね。
</J><E>
And you can be the robber.
</E></T>
<T><J>
君はとにかくどろぼうみたいなんだから」
</J><E>
You look like one, anyhow."
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
18 その言葉にふとっちょあらいぐまは腹を立てました。
</J><E>
That remark made Fatty Coon angry.
</E></T>
<T><J>
ジミーが結膜炎などにかかっていなければいいのにと思いました。
</J><E>
And he wished that Jimmy hadn't the pink-eye.
</E></T>
<T><J>
彼はただちにジミーとけりを着けたくて仕方がありませんでした。
</J><E>
He would have liked to make an end of him right then and there.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
19 「どういう意味だ？」
</J><E>
"What do you mean?"
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょはさけびました。
</J><E>
he shouted.
</E></T>
<T><J>
「ぼくはどろぼうなんかじゃない！　
</J><E>
"Robber nothing!
</E></T>
<T><J>
君と同じくらいいい子だよ！」
</J><E>
I'm just as good as you are!"
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
20 「もちさ、もちさ！」
</J><E>
"Of course, of course!"
</E></T>
<T><J>
ジミーがあわてて言いました。
</J><E>
Jimmy said hastily.
</E></T>
<T><J>
「君の顔のことだよ、ね。
</J><E>
"It's your face, you know,
</E></T>
<T><J>
その君の目のまわりの黒いぶちは、どろぼうのマスクにそっくりだろ。
</J><E>
That black patch covers your eyes just like a robber's mask.
</E></T>
<T><J>
だから君にどろぼう役になってもらいたいんだよ」
</J><E>
That's why we want you to be the robber."
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
21 ふとっちょは木からすべり下り、地面に下り立ちました。
</J><E>
Fatty had slipped down his tree to the ground;
</E></T>
<T><J>
そして、小川の水にうつった自分の顔を見下ろしました。
</J><E>
and now he looked down into the creek.
</E></T>
<T><J>
ジミーの言ったとおりでした。
</J><E>
It was just as Jimmy said.
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょはこれまで考えもしませんでしたが、彼の顔の上側を横に走っている短い毛の黒ぶちは、まさにどろぼうそっくりでした。
</J><E>
Fatty had never thought of it before, but the black patch of short fur across the upper part of his face made him look exactly like a robber.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
22 「おいでよ！」
</J><E>
"Come on!"
</E></T>
<T><J>
ジミーが言いました。
</J><E>
said Jimmy.
</E></T>
<T><J>
「君がいないと始まらないよ」
</J><E>
"We can't play the game without you."
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
23 「うん
</J><E>
"Well
</E></T>
<T><J>
……いいよ！」
</J><E>
--all right!"
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょは言いました。
</J><E>
said Fatty.
</E></T>
<T><J>
彼は、自分のマスクをほこらしく思い始めました。
</J><E>
He began to feel proud of his mask.
</E></T>
<T><J>
「ぼくは何をしたらいいの？」
</J><E>
"What shall I do?"
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
24 「君はここで待っているんだよ」
</J><E>
"You wait right here,"
</E></T>
<T><J>
ジミーが命じました。
</J><E>
Jimmy ordered.
</E></T>
<T><J>
「あの木のかげでかくれてるんだよ。
</J><E>
"Hide behind that tree.
</E></T>
<T><J>
ぼくらは森の中へ行くからね。
</J><E>
We'll go into the woods.
</E></T>
<T><J>
それで、ぼくらがこの場所にもどってきたら、ぼくらに飛びかかってこう言うんだ。
</J><E>
And when we come back past this spot you jump out and say 
</E></T>
<T><J>
『手を上げろ！』
</J><E>
'Hands up!'
</E></T>
<T><J>
……わかった？」
</J><E>
... You understand?"
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
25 「もちさ！」
</J><E>
"Of course!"
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょは言いました。
</J><E>
said Fatty.
</E></T>
<T><J>
「でもはやくもどって来てね！　
</J><E>
"But hurry up! 
</E></T>
<T><J>
長く待つのはいやだからね」
</J><E>
Don't be gone long."
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
26 「まかせといてよ」
</J><E>
"Leave that to us,"
</E></T>
<T><J>
うさぎのジミーは言いました。
</J><E>
said Jimmy Rabbit.
</E></T>
<T><J>
彼は弟にウィンクしました。
</J><E>
He winked at his brother; 
</E></T>
<T><J>
それからふたりは連れ立って森の中に去っていきました。
</J><E>
and they started off together.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
27 ふとっちょあらいぐまにはウィンクが見えませんでした。
</J><E>
Fatty Coon did not see that wink.
</E></T>
<T><J>
もしも見ていたら、午後じゅううさぎの兄弟がもどって来るのを待っていたりしなかったでしょう。
</J><E>
If he had, he wouldn't have waited there all the afternoon for those Rabbit brothers to return.
</E></T>
<T><J>
兄弟は二度ともどって来ませんでした。
</J><E>
They never came back at all.
</E></T>
<T><J>
そして、ふとっちょあらいぐまをだまくらかしたことをみんなに言いふらしました。
</J><E>
And they told everybody about the trick they had played on Fatty Coon.
</E></T>
<T><J>
それから長い間、ふとっちょはどこに行っても森の住民から、
「どろぼう！」
と背中に声を投げつけられました。
</J><E>
For a long time after that wherever Fatty went the forest-people called "Robber!" after him.
</E></T>
<T><J>
カケスのジャスパーの声は、誰よりも悩ましいものでした。
</J><E>
And Jasper Jay was the most annoying of all,
</E></T>
<T><J>
なぜなら、彼はいつでも
「どろぼう！」
とかん高い声でさけび、それはひどい大声で長いあいだ笑いつづけるからです。
</J><E>
because whenever he shouted "Robber!" he always laughed so loudly and so long.
</E></T>
<T><J>
彼のしわがれた金きり声は、森じゅうにこだましました。
</J><E>
His hoarse screech echoed through the woods.
</E></T>
<T><J>
それが何よりも悪いのは、みんなにふとっちょが笑われていることが知れわたってしまうことでした。
</J><E>
And the worst of it was, everybody knew what he was laughing at.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょ、お月さまを見つける
</J><E>
XVII
FATTY FINDS THE MOON
</E></T>
<T><J>
1 ある日森を歩きまわっていたふとっちょあらいぐまは、かがやく目でなにやら奇妙な光るものをとらえました
</J><E>
Wandering through the woods one day, Fatty Coon's bright eyes caught a strange gleam from something
</E></T>
<T><J>
――なにかがピカピカと光をはなっているのが、森の木々の葉のあいだから見えました。
</J><E>
--something that shone and glittered out of the green.
</E></T>
<T><J>
食べ物だとはとても思えませんでしたが、それでもふとっちょは、それがなんなのか見てみたいと思いました。
</J><E>
Fatty wanted to see what it was, though he hardly thought it was anything to eat.
</E></T>
<T><J>
とはいえ、なにか真新しいものにぶつかったときには、彼はいつも必ず確かめたいと思うのでした。
</J><E>
But whenever he came upon something new he always wanted to examine it.
</E></T>
<T><J>
それで、その奇妙なものを見てやろうと先をいそぎました。
</J><E>
So now Fatty hurried to see what the strange thing was.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
2 それはふとっちょがこれまで見たものの中で、一番おかしなものでした
</J><E>
It was the oddest thing he had ever found
</E></T>
<T><J>
――平たくて、丸くて、銀色をしていました。
</J><E>
--flat, round, and silvery; 
</E></T>
<T><J>
木の下の、ちょうどふとっちょの頭の上あたりの空中に、それは浮かんでいました。
</J><E>
and it hung in the air, under a tree, just over Fatty's head.
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょあらいぐまはその光るものを注意ぶかくながめました。
</J><E>
Fatty Coon looked carefully at the bright thing.
</E></T>
<T><J>
それのまわりをぐるりと歩いて、あらゆる方向から見てみました。
</J><E>
He walked all around it, so he could see it from all sides.
</E></T>
<T><J>
そしてついに、それがなんなのかわかったと思いました。
</J><E>
And at last he thought he knew what it was.
</E></T>
<T><J>
お月さまです！　
そうに違いないとふとっちょは決め込みました。
</J><E>
He made up his mind that it was the moon!
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
3 ふとっちょは空に浮かんでいるお月さまをたびたび見ていました。
</J><E>
He had often seen the moon up in the sky;
</E></T>
<T><J>
ここにある光るものは、きっかり同じ大きさで、ふとっちょが前足を伸ばせばとどくくらいとても低いところに浮かんでいました。
</J><E>
and here it was, just the same size exactly, hanging so low that he could have reached it with his paw.
</E></T>
<T><J>
彼はそれをおかしなことだとは思いませんでした。
</J><E>
He saw nothing strange in that;
</E></T>
<T><J>
お月さまが時どき地面にくっついているのを知っていたからです。
</J><E>
for he knew that the moon often touched the earth.
</E></T>
<T><J>
ブルー山の山すその上でお月さまがお休みしているのを、何度も見たではありませんか？　
</J><E>
Had he not seen it many a time, resting on the side of Blue Mountain?
</E></T>
<T><J>
ある晩、彼はお母さんにたずねました。
</J><E>
One night he had asked his mother
</E></T>
<T><J>
山にのぼったらお月さまと遊べるかしらって。
</J><E>
if he might go up on the mountain to play with the moon;
</E></T>
<T><J>
けれどお母さんは笑うだけでした。
</J><E>
but she had only laughed. 
</E></T>
<T><J>
ここにきてついに、お月さまがふとっちょのところにやって来たのです！　
</J><E>
And here, at last, was the moon come to him!
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょはひどく興奮し、家にむかって全速力で走っていきました。
</J><E>
Fatty was so excited that he ran home as fast as he could go,
</E></T>
<T><J>
お母さんや弟の黒っちょや妹のふわっちょやかわいっちょに教えるためです。
</J><E>
to tell his mother, and his brother Blackie, and Fluffy and Cutey, his sisters.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
4 「ああ！　
</J><E>
"Oh! 
</E></T>
<T><J>
月！　
</J><E>
the moon!
</E></T>
<T><J>
月！」
</J><E>
the moon!"
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょはさけびました。
</J><E>
Fatty shouted.
</E></T>
<T><J>
彼はとてもふとっており、あまりにはやく走ったので、すっかり息が切れていました。
</J><E>
He had run so fast that, being so plump, he was quite out of breath.
</E></T>
<T><J>
言うことができたのはそれだけでした。
</J><E>
And that was all he could say.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
5 「まあまあ！　
</J><E>
"Well, well!
</E></T>
<T><J>
月がどうしたっていうのさ！」
</J><E>
What about the moon!"
</E></T>
<T><J>
あらいぐま夫人がたずねました。
</J><E>
Mrs. Coon asked.
</E></T>
<T><J>
「なにか見つけたってところだね、だいたい」
</J><E>
"Anybody would think you had found it, almost."
</E></T>
<T><J>
あらいぐま夫人はほほ笑みました。
</J><E>
And she smiled.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
6 ふとっちょはハーハーゼイゼイと息をつきました。
</J><E>
Fatty puffed and gasped.
</E></T>
<T><J>
それからとうとうまた話せるようになりました。
</J><E>
And at last he caught his breath again.
</E></T>
<T><J>
7 「そうなんだ
</J><E>
"Yes
</E></T>
<T><J>
――見つけたんだよ！　
</J><E>
--I've found it!
</E></T>
<T><J>
森の中でね
</J><E>
It's over in the woods
</E></T>
<T><J>
――ここからすぐのところだよ！」
</J><E>
--just a little way from here!"
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょは言いました。
</J><E>
he said.
</E></T>
<T><J>
「おっきくて、丸くて、光ってるんだ！　
</J><E>
"Big, and round, and shiny!
</E></T>
<T><J>
みんなで行ってお家に連れてこようよ！」
</J><E>
Let's all go and bring it home!"
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
8 「まあ、まあ、まあ！」
</J><E>
"Well, well, well!"
</E></T>
<T><J>
あらいぐま夫人は困りはてました。
</J><E>
Mrs. Coon was puzzled.
</E></T>
<T><J>
森の中でお月さまを見たなんて話は、聞いたことがありません。
</J><E>
She had never heard of the moon being found in those woods;
</E></T>
<T><J>
あらいぐま夫人は、それについてどう考えればいいのかわかりませんでした。
</J><E>
and she hardly knew what to think.
</E></T>
<T><J>
「確かなのかい？」
</J><E>
"Are you sure?"
</E></T>
<T><J>
彼女はたずねました。
</J><E>
she asked.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
9 「確かだよ、お母さん！」
</J><E>
"Oh, yes, Mother!" 
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょはぐずぐずしていられませんでした。
</J><E>
Fatty could hardly wait,
</E></T>
<T><J>
先に立ってみんなを連れていきたくて仕方がありませんでした。
</J><E>
he was so eager to lead the way.
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょに何度も説得されて、あらいぐま夫人とその家族は、しぶしぶながらお月さまを見に出かけました。
</J><E>
And with many a shake of the head, Mrs. Coon, with her family, started off to see the moon.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
10 「ここだよ！」
</J><E>
"There"!
</E></T>
<T><J>
光る丸いものが見えるところまで来ると、ふとっちょはさけびました。
</J><E>
Fatty cried, as they came in sight of the bright, round thing.
</E></T>
<T><J>
「ほらね
</J><E>
"There it is
</E></T>
<T><J>
――ぼくの言ったとおりだろ！」
</J><E>
--just as I told you!" 
</E></T>
<T><J>
みんなはおどろいて大きなさけび声をあげました。
</J><E>
And they all set up a great shouting.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
11 あらいぐま夫人もさけび声をあげましたが、彼女はそれでもまだ、ふとっちょが見つけはのは本当にお月さまだろうかとちょっぴり疑っていました。
</J><E>
All but Mrs. Coon. She wasn't quite sure, even yet, that Fatty had really found the moon.
</E></T>
<T><J>
彼女は光るもにに近づき、じっと見つめました。
</J><E>
And she walked close to the shining thing and peered at it.
</E></T>
<T><J>
けれど近づきすぎてはいけません！　
</J><E>
But not too close!
</E></T>
<T><J>
あらいぐま夫人はそれに近づきすぎたりはしませんでした。
</J><E>
Mrs. Coon didn't go too near it.
</E></T>
<T><J>
彼女は子ども達に、後ろにさがっているようにときびしく言いつけました。
</J><E>
And she told her children quite sternly to stand back.
</E></T>
<T><J>
彼女のしたことは正しいことでした。
</J><E>
It was well that she did;
</E></T>
<T><J>
あらいぐま夫人はふとっちょの月からふと目をそらし、その下の地面に目をやりました
</J><E>
for when Mrs. Coon took her eyes off Fatty's moon and looked at the ground beneath it
</E></T>
<T><J>
――あぶない！　
</J><E>
--well!
</E></T>
<T><J>
彼女は後ろに飛びのきました。
</J><E>
she jumped back 
</E></T>
<T><J>
あんまりすばやく飛んだので、後ろにいた二人の子どもにぶつかってたおしてしまいました。
</J><E>
so quickly that she knocked two of her children flat on the ground.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
12 わなです！　
</J><E>
A trap!
</E></T>
<T><J>
あらいぐま夫人は、自分のすぐ足元にわながあるのを見つけたのです。
</J><E>
THAT was what Mrs. Coon saw right in front of her. 
</E></T>
<T><J>
農夫のグリーンか、彼のやとい人か、あるいはだれかが、ブリキ缶の光る板をぶらさげたわなを仕掛けたのです。
</J><E>
And Farmer Green, or his boy, or whoever it was that set the trap, had hung that bright piece of TIN over the trap 
</E></T>
<T><J>
あらいぐま夫人の家族の一ぴきがこれにじゃれつけばいいと考えて
</J><E>
hoping that one of her family would see it and play with it
</E></T>
<T><J>
――それがわななのです。
</J><E>
--and fall into the trap. 
</E></T>
<T><J>
そうなのです
</J><E>
Yes
</E></T>
<T><J>
――ふとっちょがわなの中に歩いていかなくて運がよかったのです。
</J><E>
--it was a mercy that Fatty hadn't begun knocking it about.
</E></T>
<T><J>
もしもふとっちょがわなの中に足をふみ入れていたら、わなが閉まっていたでしょう
</J><E>
For if he had he would have stepped right into the trap and it would have shut
</E></T>
<T><J>
――パチン！　
</J><E>
--SNAP!
</E></T>
<T><J>
このようにね。
</J><E>
Just like that.
</E></T>
<T><J>
そうなったら、ふとっちょはしっかりととらえられてしまっていたところでした。
</J><E>
And there he would have been, caught fast.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
13 あらいぐま夫人が家族を連れていそいでその場を立ち去ったのは、当然のことでした。
</J><E>
It was no wonder that Mrs. Coon hurried her family away from that spot.
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょは、またしても家族の先頭に立って家に帰りました。
</J><E>
And Fatty led them all home again.
</E></T>
<T><J>
だってお月さまからあんまりはやく逃げることができないのですからね。
</J><E>
He couldn't get away from his moon fast enough.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
木こりがやって来た
</J><E>
XVIII
THE LOGGERS COME
</E></T>
<T><J>
1 ふとっちょあらいぐまは、ぎょっとして目をさましました。
</J><E>
Fatty Coon was frightened;
</E></T>
<T><J>
ちょうど、ふとっちょが逃げ込んだクリの木を、農夫のグリーンと作男が切りたおしたときにそっくりな騒音が聞こえたのです。
</J><E>
he had just waked up and he heard a sound that was exactly like the noise Farmer Green and his hired man had made when they cut down the tall chestnut tree where he was perched.
</E></T>
<T><J>
2 「お母さん！　
</J><E>
"Oh, Mother!
</E></T>
<T><J>
これはなんの音なの？」
</J><E>
What is it?"
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょはさけびました。
</J><E>
he cried.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
3 「木こりたちが来てるんだよ」
</J><E>
"The loggers have come,"
</E></T>
<T><J>
あらいぐま夫人が言いました。
</J><E>
Mrs. Coon said.
</E></T>
<T><J>
「この沼の大木をぜんぶ切りたおしているのよ」
</J><E>
"They are cutting down all the big trees in the swamp."
</E></T>
<T><J>
4 「なら、ぼくたちは逃げなくちゃならないんだね？」
</J><E>
"Then we'll have to move, won't we?"
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょがたずねました。
</J><E>
Fatty asked.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
5 「いいえ！　
</J><E>
"No!
</E></T>
<T><J>
連中はこの木をかまいやしないよ」
</J><E>
They won't touch this tree,"
</E></T>
<T><J>
お母さんは言いました。
</J><E>
his mother told him.
</E></T>
<T><J>
「古い木だし、うろが空いてるからね
</J><E>
"It's an old tree, and hollow
</E></T>
<T><J>
――そういうのは切らないんだよ。
</J><E>
--so they won't chop it down. 
</E></T>
<T><J>
連中がえらぶのは、よさそうに見える木だけなんだよ」
</J><E>
It's only the good sound trees that they'll take."
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
6 「でも、この木はいい木だと思うんだけどなあ」
</J><E>
"But I thought this was a good tree."
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょは混乱しました。
</J><E>
Fatty was puzzled.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
7 「そのとおりさ！　
</J><E>
"So it is, my son!
</E></T>
<T><J>
わたしたちにとってはいい木よ。
</J><E>
It's a good tree for us.
</E></T>
<T><J>
けど、木こりたちにとってはちがうの。
</J><E>
But not for the loggers.
</E></T>
<T><J>
連中には使い道があまりないのよ」
</J><E>
They would have little use for it."
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
8 ふとっちょあらいぐまはそれを聞くと安心しました。
</J><E>
Fatty Coon felt better when he heard that.
</E></T>
<T><J>
木こりたちが働く様子を、大いに面白がって上からこっそりのぞき見しました。
</J><E>
And he had a good deal of fun, peeping down at the loggers and watching them work.
</E></T>
<T><J>
けど、注意して自分の姿が見えないようにしました。
</J><E>
But he took care that they should not see HIM. 
</E></T>
<T><J>
木こりのかがやく斧がなにをするものなのか、わかっていましたから。
</J><E>
He knew what their bright axes could do.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
9 夜になると、ふとっちょの楽しみはますます増えました。
</J><E>
When night came Fatty had still more fun.
</E></T>
<T><J>
木こりたちが寝しずまると、ふとっちょは小川のそばの森の中の彼らのキャンプに行き、おいしいごちそうをたくさん見つけました。
</J><E>
When the loggers were asleep Fatty went to their camp in the woods beside the brook and he found many good things to eat.
</E></T>
<T><J>
それらのごちそうの名前はひとつとして知りませんでしたが、
</J><E>
He did not know the names of all the goodies;
</E></T>
<T><J>
すべて同じように食べました。
</J><E>
but he ate them just the same.
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょがとりわけ気に入ったのは、じゃがいもでした。
</J><E>
He 'specially liked some potatoes
</E></T>
<T><J>
ぞんざいな調理人が、平なべの中の残り物を、たき火のそばにほったらかしにしていました。
</J><E>
which the careless cook had left in a pan near the open camp-fire.
</E></T>
<T><J>
たき火は消えていました。
</J><E>
The fire was out. 
</E></T>
<T><J>
平なべは、たき火のそばの木の切りかぶの上に置いてありました。
</J><E>
And the pan rested on a stump close beside it.
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょあらいぐまは切りかぶにのぼり、平なべの中にこっそりとしのび込みました。
</J><E>
Fatty Coon climbed up and crawled right inside the pan.
</E></T>
<T><J>
じゃがいもをひと口味見すると、ふとっちょはすっかり夢中になりました
</J><E>
And after he had had one taste of those potatoes he grew so excited
</E></T>
<T><J>
――とてもおいしい味でした
</J><E>
--they were so good
</E></T>
<T><J>
――彼は平なべをひっくり返し、切りかぶから落としてしまいました。
</J><E>
--that he tipped the pan off the stump 
</E></T>
<T><J>
じゃがいもが灰の中に転がり落ちました。
</J><E>
and the potatoes rolled right into the ashes.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
10 ブリキの平なべが下に落っこちると、ふとっちょはわきへ飛びのきました。
</J><E>
Fatty had jumped to one side, when the tin pan fell.
</E></T>
<T><J>
ガチャンガチャンとたいそう大きな音がしました。
</J><E>
It made a great clatter;
</E></T>
<T><J>
彼はほんのしばらく息をひそめ、耳をすませました。
</J><E>
and he kept very still for a few moments, while he listened.
</E></T>
<T><J>
しかし、だれも目をさまして身動きしたりしませんでした。
</J><E>
But no one stirred.
</E></T>
<T><J>
彼はじゃがいもを追いかけて灰の中にざぶんと飛び込みました。
</J><E>
And then Fatty jumped plump into the ashes.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
11 ヒャーッ！　
</J><E>
WHEW!
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょは、あらんかぎりのはやさでまた飛びのきました。
</J><E>
He jumped out again as fast as he could;
</E></T>
<T><J>
灰の下に、熱く燃えた石炭がたっぷりしかれていたのです。
</J><E>
for beneath the ashes there were plenty of hot coals.
</E></T>
<T><J>
ほんの三つ数えるあいだ立ちつづけることも我慢できないほどでした。
</J><E>
Fatty stood in them for not more than three seconds, but that was quite long enough.
</E></T>
<T><J>
彼は足のうらをやけどし、まるで百ぴきのハチに刺されたように痛みました。
</J><E>
The bottoms of his feet burned as if a hundred hornets had stung them.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
12 ふとっちょはばたばたと足を上げたり下げたりしました。
</J><E>
He stood first on one foot and then on another.
</E></T>
<T><J>
みなさんがそれを見たら、ふとっちょはダンスをしているのかしらと思ったでしょう。
</J><E>
If you could have seen him you would have thought Fatty was dancing.
</E></T>
<T><J>
みなさんはきっとお笑いになったでしょう。
</J><E>
And you might have laughed, 
</E></T>
<T><J>
彼の格好はこっけいでしたから。
</J><E>
because he looked funny.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
13 けれどふとっちょあらいぐまは笑いませんでした。
</J><E>
But Fatty Coon did not laugh.
</E></T>
<T><J>
じつのところ、彼は泣き出さんばかりでした。
</J><E>
In fact, he came very near crying. 
</E></T>
<T><J>
もうひと口食べるまで居つづけることもできませんでした。
</J><E>
And he did not wait to eat another mouthful.
</E></T>
<T><J>
彼はびっこを引きひき家に帰りました。
</J><E>
He limped along toward home.
</E></T>
<T><J>
それから数日のあいだ、彼はお母さんの家から外に出られませんでした。
</J><E>
And it was several days before he stirred out of his mother's house again.
</E></T>
<T><J>
ただベッドに横たわり、やけどが治るのを待っていました。
</J><E>
He just lay in his bed and waited until his burns were well again.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
14 それはたいそう辛いことでした。
</J><E>
It was very hard.
</E></T>
<T><J>
おいしいごちそうのことを考えて焦れることしかできないのですもの。
</J><E>
For Fatty did not like to think of all those good things to eat that he was missing.
</E></T>
<T><J>
彼は、また歩けるようになるまで木こりたちがどこにも行きませんようにと願いました。
</J><E>
And he hoped the loggers would not go away before his feet were well again.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょ、さらにふとる
</J><E>
XIX
FATTY GROWS EVEN FATTER
</E></T>
<T><J>
1 足のうらのやけどの具合がよくなったその夜、ふとっちょあらいぐまはお母さんの家を出て、また木こりのキャンプに向かいました。
</J><E>
When Fatty Coon's burned feet were well once more, the very first night he left his mother's house he went straight to the loggers' camp.
</E></T>
<T><J>
暗くなるまでじっと待ってなんていませんでした。
</J><E>
He did not wait long after dark,
</E></T>
<T><J>
だって、森の隣人たちがキャンプのおいしい食べ物を見つけてしまうんじゃないかと心配でしたから。
</J><E>
because he was afraid that some of his neighbors might have found that there were good things to eat about the camp.
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょは、すべてひとり占めにしたかったのです。
</J><E>
And Fatty wanted them all.
</E></T>
<T><J>
2 うれしいことに、ごちそうはほとんど尽きることがありませんでした。
</J><E>
To his delight, there were goodies almost without end. 
</E></T>
<T><J>
彼はキャンプをかぎ回り、じゃがいもの皮やベーコンのかけらをつまみ食いしました。
</J><E>
He nosed about, picking up potato peelings, and bits of bacon. 
</E></T>
<T><J>
すべてのごちそうのうちでおそらく一番おいしいのは、とうもろこしパンでした。
</J><E>
And perhaps the best of all was a piece of cornbread,
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょはこれをがつがつと大いにむさぼり食べました。
</J><E>
which Fatty fairly gobbled. 
</E></T>
<T><J>
それから、彼はなにかが半分ほどつまった箱を見つけました
</J><E>
And then he found a box half-full of something
</E></T>
<T><J>
――中身はリンゴのような味のする切れっぱしでしたが、ただリンゴみたいに丸くないし、みずみずしくなくてすっかり乾いていました。
</J><E>
--scraps that tasted like apples, only they were not round like apples, and they were quite dry, instead of being juicy.
</E></T>
<T><J>
けれどふとっちょはこれが気に入りました。
</J><E>
But Fatty liked them;
</E></T>
<T><J>
最後のちっぽけなくずまで、きれいに平らげました。
</J><E>
and he ate them all, down to the smallest bit.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
3 それから、彼はのどが乾きました。
</J><E>
He was thirsty, then.
</E></T>
<T><J>
それでキャンプのそばを流れる小川に下っていきました。
</J><E>
So he went down to the brook, which ran close by the camp.
</E></T>
<T><J>
木こりたちは小川に張った氷に穴をあけ、そこで水をくめるようにしていました。
</J><E>
The loggers had cut a hole through the ice, so they could get water.
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょはこの穴のふちに歩いていき、水を飲みました。
</J><E>
And Fatty crept close to the edge of the hole and drank.
</E></T>
<T><J>
彼はずいぶんとたっぷり水を飲みました。
</J><E>
He drank a great deal of water,
</E></T>
<T><J>
ひどくのどが乾いていたからです。
</J><E>
because he was very thirsty.
</E></T>
<T><J>
飲み終わると、しばらくのあいだ氷の上に座り込んで休みました。
</J><E>
And when he had finished he sat down on the ice for a time.
</E></T>
<T><J>
その時、木こりたちが目を覚ますおそれなど気になりませんでした。
</J><E>
He did not care to stir about just then.
</E></T>
<T><J>
それに、もうなんにも食べようという気が起こりませんでした。
</J><E>
And he did not think he would ever want anything to eat again.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
4 そらからとうとうふとっちょあらいぐまは、立ち上がりました。
</J><E>
At last Fatty Coon rose to his feet. 
</E></T>
<T><J>
とてもおかしな感じがしました。
</J><E>
He felt very queer.
</E></T>
<T><J>
おかしいのは、お腹が張っている感じがするせいでした。
</J><E>
There was a strange, tight feeling about his stomach.
</E></T>
<T><J>
彼のわき腹は、もはややせていませんでした。
</J><E>
And his sides were no longer thin.
</E></T>
<T><J>
冬が来る前のようにつき出ていました
</J><E>
They stuck out just as they had before winter came
</E></T>
<T><J>
――でも、それ以上でした。
</J><E>
--only more so.
</E></T>
<T><J>
これにはふとっちょもぎくりとしました。
</J><E>
And what alarmed Fatty was this:
</E></T>
<T><J>
みるみるうちに、どんどんどんどんわき腹がつき出していくようなのです。
</J><E>
his sides seemed to be sticking out more and more all the time.
</E></T>
<T><J>
5 自分はいったいなにを食べたのかしらと、ふとっちょは首をかしげました。
</J><E>
He wondered what he had been eating.
</E></T>
<T><J>
リンゴのような味のする乾いたもの
</J><E>
Those dry things that tasted like apples
</E></T>
<T><J>
――これはいったいなにかしら。
</J><E>
--he wondered what they were.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
6 さて、このスポンジのようにふかふかで平べったい、おかしなものが入った箱の外側には、ラベルが貼ってありました。
</J><E>
Now, there was some printing on the outside of the box which held those queer, spongy, flat things.
</E></T>
<T><J>
もちろんふとっちょあらいぐまは字が読めませんから、彼にはこれがまったく役に立ちませんでした。
</J><E>
Of course, Fatty Coon could not read, so the printing did him no good at all.
</E></T>
<T><J>
けれど、字が読めるくらいに大きいみなさんがこの箱のラベルを見たならば、こんなふうに読むでしょう。
</J><E>
But if you had seen the box, and if you are old enough to read, you would have known that the printing said:
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
7 『エバ・アップル』。
</J><E>
EVAPORATED APPLES
</E></T>
<T><J>
8 エバ・アップルというのは、乾燥リンゴのことにほかなりません。
</J><E>
Now, evaporated apples are nothing more or less than dried apples. 
</E></T>
<T><J>
木こりのキャンプの調理人は、これを使ってアップルパイを作っていました。
</J><E>
The cook of the loggers' camp used them to make apple pies.
</E></T>
<T><J>
調理人はパイを作り始める前に、いつも最初にこの乾燥リンゴを水につけてふやかしておきます。
</J><E>
And first, before making his pies, he always soaked them in water 
</E></T>
<T><J>
すると、乾燥リンゴはふくれ上がります。
</J><E>
so they would swell.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
9 さて、どうしてふとっちょあらいぐまがひどくおかしな感じがして心地わるくなったのか、みなさんはおわかりですね。
</J><E>
Now you see what made Fatty Coon feel so queer and uncomfortable.
</E></T>
<T><J>
彼は最初に乾燥リンゴを食べたのです。
</J><E>
He had first eaten his dried apples.
</E></T>
<T><J>
そして小川の水を飲んだことにより、お腹の中で乾燥リンゴをふやかしてしまったのです。
</J><E>
And then he had soaked them, by drinking out of the brook.
</E></T>
<T><J>
彼のわき腹がつき出したのも不思議ではありません。
</J><E>
It was no wonder that his sides stuck out,
</E></T>
<T><J>
丸呑みしたリンゴの切れはしがぷうっとふくらんで、お腹が破れつしそうになるまでに大きくなってしまったのです。
</J><E>
for the apples that he had bolted were swelling and puffing him out until he felt that he should burst.
</E></T>
<T><J>
実際のところ、ふとっちょがお母さんの家にたどり着いたとき、戸口の穴をくぐり抜けられたのが不思議なほどでした。
</J><E>
In fact, the wonder of it was that he was able to get through his mother's doorway, when he reached home.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
10 ふとっちょは小さくウーンとうめき声を上げ、なんとか戸口をくぐり抜けました。
</J><E>
But he did it, though it cost him a few groans.
</E></T>
<T><J>
これにはお母さんもぎょっとしました。
</J><E>
And he frightened his mother, too.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
11 「お前が食べたのが毒でないことを祈るばかりだよ」
</J><E>
"I only hope you're not poisoned,"
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょが自分のしたことを話すと、お母さんが言いました。
</J><E>
she said, when Fatty told her what he had been doing.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
12 この言葉に、ふとっちょはますますおびえました。
</J><E>
And that remark frightened Fatty more than ever.
</E></T>
<T><J>
彼はもう一生よくなることはないのだと信じ込みました。
</J><E>
He was sure he was never going to feel any better.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
13 哀れなあらいぐま夫人は、その夜中たいそう心配しました。
</J><E>
Poor Mrs. Coon was much worried all the rest of the night. 
</E></T>
<T><J>
けれど朝になると、ふとっちょが峠を越えたことを知りました。
</J><E>
But when morning came she knew that Fatty was out of danger. 
</E></T>
<T><J>
どうしてわかったのかというと、ふとっちょがこう言ったからです。
</J><E>
She knew it because of something he said. 
</E></T>
<T><J>
こうですよ。
</J><E>
It was this:
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
14 「あーあ！　
</J><E>
"Oh, dear!

雪の上の足あと
</J><E>
XX
THE TRACKS IN THE SNOW
</E></T>
<T><J>
1 冬のある晴れた日、ふとっちょあらいぐまは雪の上におかしな足あとがあるのに出くわしました。
</J><E>
One fine winter's day Fatty Coon came upon the queerest tracks in the snow.
</E></T>
<T><J>
それは大きな足あとでした
</J><E>
They were huge
</E></T>
<T><J>
――クマの足あとさえ、これよりずっと小さいくらいでした。
</J><E>
--a great deal bigger, even, than bear-tracks,
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょはクマの足あとなら何度か見たことがありました。
</J><E>
which Fatty had sometimes seen, for once in a while,
</E></T>
<T><J>
辺りがひどく冷え込んでクマが冬眠する季節がせまると、クマは時どき彼の家のあるブルー山を下りて谷間にやって来るのです。
</J><E>
before the weather grew too cold, and he fell into his winter's sleep, a bear would come down into the valley from his home on Blue Mountain.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
2 けれどこの足あとは、クマの足あとの六倍もありました。
</J><E>
But these were six times as big as bear tracks. 
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょは、恐ろしさに背中の上から下までふるえが走るのをかんじました。
</J><E>
And Fatty felt a shiver of fear run up and down his back.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
3 ふとっちょは足あとを少したどっていきました。
</J><E>
He followed the trail a little way.
</E></T>
<T><J>
けれどとても用心深くしていました。
</J><E>
But he was very careful.
</E></T>
<T><J>
いつでも木に駆け上れるように身がまえていました。
</J><E>
He was always ready to scramble up a tree,
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふいにおかしな動物と出くわしたときにそなえて
</J><E>
in case he should suddenly see the strange animal
</E></T>
<T><J>
――というか、そのおかしな動物が彼の姿に気づいたときにそなえて。
</J><E>
--or rather, in case the strange animal should see HIM.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
4 その巨大な足あとは、農夫のグリーンの家にまっすぐにむかっていました。
</J><E>
The great tracks led straight toward Farmer Green's house.
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょはそこへは近づきたくありませんでした。
</J><E>
And Fatty did not want to go there.
</E></T>
<T><J>
ですから、お母さんに見つけたもののことをたずねようと、家に走っていきました。
</J><E>
So he hurried home to ask his mother what he had found.
</E></T>
<T><J>
あらいぐま夫人はふとっちょの話に耳をかたむけました。
</J><E>
Mrs. Coon listened to Fatty's story.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
5 「あの怪物だと思うんだ。
</J><E>
"I think it must be the monster 
</E></T>
<T><J>
去年の夏に、ぼくが道でもうちょっとでつかまえられそうになったやつさ」
</J><E>
that almost caught me in the road last summer,"
</E></T>
<T><J>
と、ふとっちょは言いました。
</J><E>
said Fatty,
</E></T>
<T><J>
怪物とは自動車のことです。
</J><E>
meaning the automobile 
</E></T>
<T><J>
彼はそれにたいそう恐い思いをさせれたのです。
</J><E>
that had given him a great fright.
</E></T>
<T><J>
「もしかして、農夫のグリーンさんと家族をつかまえにもどって来たのかなあ
</J><E>
"Maybe he's come back again to catch Farmer Green and his family
</E></T>
<T><J>
……あの人たちは食べられちゃうんだと思う？」
</J><E>
... Do you suppose he's eaten them up?"
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
6 あらいぐま夫人は困わくしました。
</J><E>
Mrs. Coon was puzzled.
</E></T>
<T><J>
それに、少しょう警戒しました。
</J><E>
And she was somewhat alarmed, too.
</E></T>
<T><J>
自分の目でそのおかしな足あとを見てみたいと思いました。
</J><E>
She wanted to see those strange tracks herself.
</E></T>
<T><J>
それでほかの子どもたちに、彼女がもどって来るまで家から一歩も出てはならないと命じました。
</J><E>
So she told her other children not to step a foot out of the house until she came back.
</E></T>
<T><J>
そしてふとっちょに、ひとっ走り行ってその怪物の足あとに出くわした場所に彼女を案内するように言いました。
</J><E>
And then she asked Fatty to run along and show her where he had come upon the monster's trail.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
7 お母さんの先に立って沼を横ぎり、森に入る道すがら、これは重大事だとふとっちょあらいぐまは思いました。
</J><E>
Fatty Coon felt very important, as he led the way across the swamp and into the woods.
</E></T>
<T><J>
お母さんを案内することなんてめったにありませんもの。
</J><E>
It was not often that he could show his mother anything.
</E></T>
<T><J>
彼は誇らしい気分にひたるあまり、恐ろしいのをほとんど忘れかけました。
</J><E>
And he was so proud that he almost forgot his fright.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
8 「ぼくの目がするどいんで、お母さんもよかっただろ」
</J><E>
"I guess you're glad I have sharp eyes," 
</E></T>
<T><J>
道をいそぎながら、ふとっちょは言いました。
</J><E>
he said, as they hurried along.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
9 「その足あとがお前が言うほど大きいんなら、たいしてするどくなくたって見えるだろう」
</J><E>
"If the tracks are as big as you say they are, your eyes wouldn't have to be very sharp to see them,"
</E></T>
<T><J>
お母さんはふとっちょに言いました。
</J><E>
his mother told him. 
</E></T>
<T><J>
あらいぐま夫人は、自分の子が自慢話をするのを聞くのが大嫌いでした。
</J><E>
Mrs. Coon never liked to hear her children boast.
</E></T>
<T><J>
どんな者であろうと自慢話をするのは嫌がられることの一つであるのを、知っていたのです。
</J><E>
She knew that boasting is one of the most unpleasant things anyone can do.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
10 「ふーん
</J><E>
"Well
</E></T>
<T><J>
……ぼくが怪物の足あとを見たっていうの、ぜんぜん信じてないんだね」
</J><E>
--maybe you don't think I saw the monster's tracks at all," 
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょは言いました。
</J><E>
said Fatty.
</E></T>
<T><J>
「ぼくがあいつの絶叫を聞いたっていうのも――」
</J><E>
"Maybe you don't think I heard him screech--"
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
11 「いつ絶叫を聞いたんだって？」
</J><E>
"When did you hear him screech?"
</E></T>
<T><J>
あらいぐま夫人がたずねました。
</J><E>
Mrs. Coon asked.
</E></T>
<T><J>
「『絶叫』だなんて言うの、これが初めてじゃないか。
</J><E>
"This is the first you've said about SCREECHING. 
</E></T>
<T><J>
それはいつのことなの？」
</J><E>
When was it?"
</E></T>
<T><J>
12 「去年の夏だよう」
</J><E>
"Last summer," 
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょが言いました。
</J><E>
Fatty answered.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
13 あらいぐま夫人は笑いませんでした。
</J><E>
Mrs. Coon didn't smile.
</E></T>
<T><J>
おそらく、あんまり心配しすぎていたせいでしょう。
</J><E>
Perhaps she was too worried for that.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
14 「同じ怪物ではないかもしれないよ」
</J><E>
"It may not be the same monster,"
</E></T>
<T><J>
あらいぐま夫人は言いました。
</J><E>
she said.
</E></T>
<T><J>
「ちっとも怪物ではないかもしれないよ」
</J><E>
"It may not be a monster at all."
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
15 けれど今回は、ふとっちょは自分は間違っていないと確信していました。
</J><E>
But by this time Fatty was sure he was right.
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょは、お母さんよりも自分のほうが多くのことを知っているのだと確信しました。
</J><E>
He was sure he knew more than his mother.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
16 「このまま農夫のグリーンさんの家へ行こうよ、ニワトリをつかまえにさ」
</J><E>
"Why can't we go right over to Farmer Green's and take some of his chickens?"
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょは言いました。
</J><E>
he asked.
</E></T>
<T><J>
「あの怪物、今ごろきっとグリーンさんを食べてるよ。
</J><E>
"The monster has probably eaten him by this time, 
</E></T>
<T><J>
グリーンさんの家族も全員ね」
</J><E>
and all his family, too."
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
17 けれどあらいぐま夫人は、そんなことをするつもりはありませんでした。
</J><E>
But Mrs. Coon would do no such thing.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
18 「足あとをお見せ」
</J><E>
"Show me the tracks,"
</E></T>
<T><J>
あらいぐま夫人はがんとして言いました。
</J><E>
she said firmly.
</E></T>
<T><J>
そして、ふたりは森の中に入っていきました。
</J><E>
And so they went on into the woods.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
19 「これだよ！」
</J><E>
"There they are!"
</E></T>
<T><J>
数分後、ふとっちょあらいぐまはさけびました。
</J><E>
Fatty cried, a few minutes later.
</E></T>
<T><J>
「ほらね、お母さん！
</J><E>
"See, Mother!
</E></T>
<T><J>
ぼくが言ったよりも大きいくらいじゃないか」
</J><E>
They're even bigger than I said."
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょあらいぐまは、背後がおかしな音がするのを聞きました。
</J><E>
He heard a funny noise behind him, then.
</E></T>
<T><J>
辺りを見まわしてみますと、まさにお母さんが両腕でわき腹を抱え込んだところでした。
</J><E>
And when Fatty Coon looked around he saw that his mother was actually holding her sides, 
</E></T>
<T><J>
お母さんは、はげしく笑い転げました。
</J><E>
she was laughing so hard.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
20 「それは農夫のグリーンの足あとさ」
</J><E>
"Those are Farmer Green's tracks,"
</E></T>
<T><J>
さんざん笑ってようやく話せるようになると、お母さんはすぐさま言いました。
</J><E>
she said, as soon as she could stop laughing long enough to speak.
</E></T>
<T><J>
21 「どうして
</J><E>
"What
</E></T>
<T><J>
……こんなに大きいんだよ？」
</J><E>
--as big as that?"
</E></T>
<T><J>
ふとっちょは、雪の上の巨大なこん跡を指さしました。
</J><E>
Fatty pointed at the huge prints in the snow.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
22 「かんじきだよ！」
</J><E>
"Snowshoes!"
</E></T>
<T><J>
あらいぐま夫人は言いました。
</J><E>
Mrs. Coon said.
</E></T>
<T><J>
「かんじきをはいていたのよ
</J><E>
"He was wearing snowshoes
</E></T>
<T><J>
――かんじきっていうのはね、木の枝と革ひもで作った大きなげたのことよ。
</J><E>
--great frames made of thongs and sticks, 
</E></T>
<T><J>
これをはくと、雪の中に足が沈みこむのを防げるのさ」
</J><E>
to keep him from sinking into the snow."
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
23 それが、ふとっちょの怪物の正体なのでした。
</J><E>
So that was all there was to Fatty's monster.
</E></T>
<T><J>
彼はいくぶんがっかりしました。
</J><E>
Somehow, he was disappointed. 
</E></T>
<T><J>
けれど、それがわかって大よろこびしました。
</J><E>
But he was very glad 
</E></T>
<T><J>
カケスのジャスパーにおかしな動物の話をしないで済んだのですもの。
</J><E>
he had said nothing to Jasper Jay about his strange animal.
</E></T>
<T><J>
もしも話していたら、一生うわさされ続けるに決まっていますから。
</J><E>
For if he had, he knew he would never have heard the last of it.
</E></T>
<T><J>
</J><E>
</E></T>
<T><J>
24 ふとっちょは別のことでもよろこびました。
</J><E>
And Fatty was glad about another thing, too.
</E></T>
<T><J>
お母さんが、ふとっちょが農夫のグリーンのニワトリをつかまえに行くのをゆるさなかったのは、とても幸運だったと思うのでした。
</J><E>
He felt very happy that his mother had not let him go after Farmer Green's chickens.
