M. Seurel had come down the two steps of his desk where he had been giving us a dictation, and Meaulnes walked towards him looking aggressive.
Meaulnes and I knew so well all the corners and corridors of the big building that we could clearly see, as on a plan, the positions from which the unknown people were launching their attack.
Look at the boarding of this house last night; wasn't it well managed? Didn't it come off well?
They even confided to us, while M. Seurel was starting off again at the head of our party : 'There was another chap as went by. That tall fellow, you know. . .
'Well,' I said, 'just for a childish promise you made you are now going to wreck your happiness.'
No doubt Yvonne de Galais should have shaken him out of this, and, taking his head in her hands, have said to him: 'What do I care what you did! I love you; are not all men sinners?'
In the passage he begins to strike, then he closes the door to beat the wretched man in peace . . . This terrible thought comes to me: "I have renounced paradise and am now stamping my feet at the gates of hell."
Mrs. Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise concerning that gentleman, and required information; and Elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herself.
He was writing and, without raising his head, coolly replied:
Had he done his duty in that respect, Lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle for whatever of honour or credit could now be purchased for her. The satisfaction of prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in Great Britain to be her husband might then have rested in its proper place.
In short, I began the process of ruining myself in the received style, like any other spoony.
"I think I had better just look in upon her before any of the ladies go," said Colonel Dent. "Tell her, Sam, a gentleman is coming."
"I hope no one is dead," I said, glancing at his black dress.
Feeling without judgment is a washy draught indeed; but judgment untempered by feeling is too bitter and husky a morsel for human deglutition.
She then peeped round to where I sat; so stern a neighbour was too restrictive to him, in his present fractious mood, she dared whisper no observations, nor ask of him any information.
Oh, for but a crust! for but one mouthful to allay the pang of famine!
He just looked in at the doors I opened; and when he had wandered upstairs and downstairs, he said I must have gone through a great deal of fatigue and trouble to have effected such considerable changes in so short a time: but not a syllable did he utter indicating pleasure in the improved aspect of his abode.
And she began thinking over other children she knew, who might do very well as pigs, and was just saying to herself, 'if one only knew the right way to change them--' when she was a little startled by seeing the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of a tree a few yards off.
A large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden: the roses growing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at it, busily painting them red.
The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, which seemed to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the other: the only difficulty was, that her flamingo was gone across to the other side of the garden, where Alice could see it trying in a helpless sort of way to fly up into a tree.
Alice could see, as well as if she were looking over their shoulders, that all the jurors were writing down 'stupid things!' on their slates, and she could even make out that one of them didn't know how to spell 'stupid,' and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him.
One day after this, as she came into the room where all we poor children were at work, she sat down just over against me, not in her usual place as mistress, but as if she set herself on purpose to observe me and see me work. I was doing something she had set me to; as I remember, it was marking some shirts which she had taken to make, and after a while she began to talk to me.
He told me that up a great way beyond the moon, that was beyond the setting of the moon, which must be west from their country, there dwelt white bearded men, like me, and pointed to my great whiskers, which I mentioned before; and that they had killed much mans, that was his word: by all which I understood he meant the Spaniards, whose cruelties in America had been spread over the whole country, and were remembered by all the nations from father to son.
I opened the casement and looked out.
I peeped through, and there was Bonaventure de Lapp standing inside the keep, and peeping out through the very hole at which I had seen his face.
"I am going out now to take a tally of our losses," said the Major; "and if you cared to come with me, I should be very glad to have you."
"I recommend, sir, that you take a cab, call off your spaniel who is scratching at my front door, and proceed to Waterloo to meet Sir Henry Baskerville."
"I am presuming that the cause of his fears came to him across the moor.
MY DEAR HOLMES,--My previous letters and telegrams have kept you pretty well up to date as to all that has occurred in this most God-forsaken corner of the world.
What the scene meant I could not imagine, but it seemed to me that Stapleton was abusing Sir Henry, who offered explanations, which became more angry as the other refused to accept them.
"I guess we are aiding and abetting a felony, Watson?
Only a few weeks ago she was cleaning out Sir Charles's study--it had never been touched since his death--and she found the ashes of a burned letter in the back of the grate.
I had been casting round for some excuse by which I could get away from his gossip, but now I began to wish to hear more of it.
My friend and I were strolling on the moor when we heard a cry."
Watson was asking for orders."
Creep forward quietly and see what they are doing--but for heaven's sake don't let them know that they are watched!"
It chanced one summer morning, when Boy Jim and I were standing by the smithy door, that there came a private coach from Brighton, with its four fresh horses, and its brass-work shining, flying along with such a merry rattle and jingling, that the Champion came running out with a hall-fullered shoe in his tongs to have a look at it.
He instantly fell, resigned his breath, And closed his languid eyes in death." There was more of it, and I dare say it is all still to be read in Patcham Churchyard.
She was so strange a figure, with some sort of purple wrapper on, and her big, flushed face smiling out of it, that I might, if I had been alone, have taken to my heels at the sight of her.
He shot a mischievous glance at my mother as he spoke, and she laid down her knitting on her lap and looked very earnestly at him.
With every turn I peered ahead, looking for our opponents, but my uncle seemed to concern himself very little about them, and occupied himself in giving me advice, mixed up with so many phrases of the craft, that it was all that I could do to follow him.
"Easy now, my beauties!" cried my uncle, settling down into his seat again, and looking back over his shoulder.
Glancing in, I saw a line of little green baize tables with small groups of men sitting round, while at one side was a longer one, from which there came a continuous murmur of voices.
I was speaking of your brother, Jem."
I 'eard the thump of it, and I kind o' velt somethin' vistle past me, but ven I looked there vas the Eytalian a feelin' of 'is muscles in the middle o' the stage, and as to Bob, there vern't no sign' of 'im at all no more'n if 'e'd never been."
She carried herself in the most stately fashion, so that as I looked at her majestic entrance, and at the pose which she struck as she glanced at my father, I was reminded of the Queen of the Peruvians as, in the person of Miss Polly Hinton, she incited Boy Jim and myself to insurrection.
One eye was disfigured and sightless from a wound, but the other looked from my father to myself with the quickest and shrewdest of expressions.
He opened a door as he spoke, and looking in we saw a score of well- dressed men, some of whose faces had become familiar to me during my short West End career, seated round a table upon which stood a steaming soup-tureen filled with punch.
Looking at the gig, I saw that it was indeed Mrs. Harrison who was seated in it.
"As his patron, Sir Lothian, you should direct the sponge to be thrown up."
We had got as far as Whiteman's Green, which is rather more than midway between Crawley Down and Friars' Oak, when, looking backwards, I saw far down the road the gleam of the sun upon a high yellow carriage.
"He has had the same summons as we, and is bound for the same destination," said my uncle, glancing over his shoulder at the distant barouche.
In the yellow glare of the carriage-lamp I saw the baronet look up at our windows, and if hatred could have killed, his eyes would have been as deadly as his pistol.
All I know is that the melody brought back that recollection, and, coming up to her, I took her head between my hands and kissed her. "You forgive me?"
"I was about to say to these gentlemen," added he, "that I forbid my Musketeers to expose their lives needlessly; for brave men are very dear to the king, and the king knows that his Musketeers are the bravest on the earth.
Bicarat was a Gascon, as d’Artagnan was; he turned a deaf ear, and contented himself with laughing, and between two parries finding time to point to a spot of earth with his sword, "Here," cried he, parodying a verse of the Bible, "here will Bicarat die; for I only am left, and they seek my life."
"Will you tell me that your three damned Musketeers, Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, and your youngster from Bearn, have not fallen, like so many furies, upon poor Bernajoux, and have not maltreated him in such a fashion that probably by this time he is dead?
He took to his heels, and was soon at M. de Treville’s; but instead of going into the saloon with the rest of the crowd, he asked to be introduced to M. de Treville’s office.
Only to think of it makes my flesh crawl.
As he passed the Hotel des Gardes, he took a glance in to the stables. Three of the four horses had already arrived.
Planchet, all astonishment, was busy grooming them, and had already finished two.
D’Artagnan leaned against the hedge, after having cast a glance behind it.
Without waiting for the permission of his host, d’Artagnan went quickly into the house, and cast a rapid glance at the bed.
Aramis cast a glance upon d’Artagnan to see what effect all this produced, and found his friend gaping enough to split his jaws.
D’Artagnan cast a glance around him.
If, on the other side, it was not she--which was still quite possible--for the little light that remained rendered a mistake easy--might it not be the commencement of some plot against him through the allurement of this woman, for whom his love was known?
The young man cast a glance at the first musket and saw, with a certain degree of inquietude, that it was leveled in his direction; but as soon as he perceived that the orifice of the barrel was motionless, he threw himself upon the ground.
He immediately, therefore, took to his heels and ran toward the camp, with the swiftness of the young men of his country, so renowned for their agility; but whatever might be his speed, the first who fired, having had time to reload, fired a second shot, and this time so well aimed that it struck his hat, and carried it ten paces from him.
On the morning of the eighth day, Bazin, fresh as ever, and smiling, according to custom, entered the cabaret of the Parpaillot as the four friends were sitting down to breakfast, saying, as had been agreed upon: "Monsieur Aramis, the answer from your cousin."
"What does you mean by boor Michon?" said the Swiss, who was chatting with the four friends when the letter came.
Athos cast a glance over the epistle, and to disperse all the suspicions that might have been created, read aloud:
She cast a glance at the door; the baron had had a plank nailed over the grating. He no doubt feared that by this opening she might still by some diabolical means corrupt her guards.
Then, collecting all her strength, she took the head of the young man between her hands, looked at him for an instant as if her whole soul passed into that look, and with a sobbing cry pressed her lips to his.
Athos cast a cold and indifferent glance upon the objects we have described, and at the invitation of him whom he came to seek sat down near him.
The Chevalier de Rochefort cast a glance backward, and saw that Porthos and Aramis had placed themselves between him and the gate; he understood that he was completely at the mercy of these four men.
Finally, to keep up with the times, he took in "La Ruche Medicale," a new journal whose prospectus had been sent him.
His chief was away; he just glanced at the briefs, then cut himself a pen, and at last took up his hat and went out.
And one must be master of all the principles of hygiene in order to direct, criticize the construction of buildings, the feeding of animals, the diet of domestics. And, moreover, Madame Lefrancois, one must know botany, be able to distinguish between plants, you understand, which are the wholesome and those that are deleterious, which are unproductive and which nutritive, if it is well to pull them up here and re-sow them there, to propagate some, destroy others; in brief, one must keep pace with science by means of pamphlets and public papers, be always on the alert to find out improvements."
He sent to Rouen for Dr. Duval's volume, and every evening, holding his head between both hands, plunged into the reading of it.
From what I hear, he's a regular dog; he's rolling in money; he's taking three mistresses and a cook along with him.
Suddenly she seized his head between her hands, kissed him hurriedly on the forehead, crying, "Adieu!" and rushed down the stairs.
This was like a thunderclap.
He by no means gave up his shop. On the contrary, he kept well abreast of new discoveries.
The archdeacon returned to his chamber dumbfounded, comprehending at last who Gossip Tourangeau was, and recalling that passage of the register of Sainte−Martin, of Tours:−− ~Abbas beati Martini, SCILICET REX FRANCIAE, est canonicus de consuetudine et habet parvam proebendam quam habet sanctus Venantius, et debet sedere in sede thesaurarii~.
Like civilization, it has turned a page, and the new spirit of the time finds her ready to write at its dictation.
The poor of her day had made her a fine funeral, with tears and benedictions; but, to their great regret, the pious maid had not been canonized, for lack of influence.
The crowd was swarming around her; from time to time, a man accoutred in red and yellow made them form into a circle, and then returned, seated himself on a chair a few paces from the dancer, and took the goat's head on his knees.
We do not know whether he suddenly became conscious of these things; but, giddy as he was, he understood that he had seen what he ought not to have seen, that he had just surprised the soul of his elder brother in one of its most secret altitudes, and that Claude must not be allowed to know it.
"Yes," resumed Gringoire, talking to himself and touching his nose with his forefinger in sign of meditation,−−"that's it!−−The thieves are brave fellows!−−The tribe of Egypt love her!−−They will rise at the first word!−−Nothing easier!−−A sudden stroke.−−Under cover of the disorder, they will easily carry her off!−−Beginning to−morrow evening. They will ask nothing better.
Jehan who formed the head, and who was whistling, completed the illusion.
"At the moment when we arrived on the Parvis, through the enraged outcasts, did your reverence observe that poor little devil whose skull your deaf man was just cracking on the railing of the gallery of the kings?
"To die!" said Gudule, staggering as though struck by lightning; "to die!" she repeated slowly, gazing at her daughter with staring eyes.
It was presumed that he had broken the body when taking the soul, like monkeys who break the shell to get at the nut.
I got down the book, and read all I came to read; and then, in an unthinking moment, I idly turned the leaves, and began to indolently study diseases, generally.
I sat for awhile, frozen with horror; and then, in the listlessness of despair, I again turned over the pages.
Then he opened me and looked down me, and clutched hold of my wrist, and then he hit me over the chest when I wasn't expecting it - a cowardly thing to do, I call it - and immediately afterwards butted me with the side of his head.
That's Harris all over - so ready to take the burden of everything himself, and put it on the backs of other people.
George said: "You know we are on a wrong track altogether.
"Now for breakfast we shall want a frying-pan" - (Harris said it was indigestible; but we merely urged him not to be an ass, and George went on) - "a tea-pot and a kettle, and a methylated spirit stove."
That's just like Harris.
He might have been up stuffing himself with eggs and bacon, irritating the dog, or flirting with the slavey, instead of sprawling there, sunk in soul-clogging oblivion.
He's larking about somewhere, that's what he's doing, leaving us to do all the work.
I'm going to get out, and have a drink."
Much of this sort of trouble would be saved if those who are towing would keep remembering that they are towing, and give a pretty frequent look round to see how their man is getting on.
The river stretched out straight before us in the twilight for about a mile; not a ghost of a lock was to be seen.
They had hinges in the middle, and, when we were not looking, they nipped us with these hinges in delicate parts of the body; and, while we were wrestling with one side of the hoop, and endeavouring to persuade it to do its duty, the other side would come behind us in a cowardly manner, and hit us over the head.
It said: "Give us a hand here, can't you, you cuckoo; standing there like a stuffed mummy, when you see we are both being suffocated, you dummy!"
George came and had a look at it - it was about the size of a pea-nut.
"Fancy old George talking about work!" he laughed; "why, about half-an- hour of it would kill him.
"Why, the Alhambra would be almost more lively," said Harris, venturing his head outside the cover for a moment and taking a survey of the sky.
I was shavingmyself when you took it out and laid in on a chair by your side with apile of letters of which you burned half.
How little you know me!" with such a burst of genuineaffection that, with a cry, she seized his head by the hair with bothhands, and dragging him violently to her kissed him distractedly allover his face.
The sudden entry of this man was the last straw to Julien.
'And I,' she exclaimed, rising, and taking Julien's head in her hands, and holding it at arm's length before her eyes, 'and I, shall I love you like a brother?
[Footnote: A poem by Delphine Gay] He was in the mood for literary conversation, and at once forgot the abbe Pirard and everything else, in discussing with the seminarist the important question, whether Horace had been rich or poor.
Captain Nemo resumed the lead in our little band, always heading forward without hesitation.
The captain glanced at the chart.
When he was captured, he was in the act of making a description and sketch of the battle.
The latter took Top's head between his hands, and unfastening the collar which the animal wore round his neck, he broke it in two, saying,-- "There are two knives, Pencroft!"
He fell thunderstruck on a seat.
Fix had begun by winning several guineas, which he seemed likely to lose; but he showed himself a not less eager whist-player than Mr. Fogg.
He was about to make an observation to the guide, who without answering resumed his place at the head, and went on his way.
My uncle shot a triumphant glance at me.
Hans with perfect coolness resumed the lead, and I followed him without a word.
The unforeseen nature of this spectacle brought back the colour to my cheeks. I was under a new course of treatment with the aid of astonishment, and my convalescence was promoted by this novel system of therapeutics; besides, the dense and breezy air invigorated me, supplying more oxygen to my lungs.
I look at our guns and see that they are all right.
At that very moment, a sudden thought came into Candide's head. "If this holy man," thought he, "should call assistance, I shall most undoubtedly be consigned to the flames, and Miss Cunegund may perhaps meet with no better treatment: besides, he was the cause of my being so cruelly whipped; he is my rival; and as I have now begun to dip my hands in blood, I will kill away, for there is no time to hesitate."
These words were like a clap of thunder to Candide; he wept bitterly for a long time, and, taking Cacambo aside, he said to him, "I'll tell you, my dear friend, what you must do.
Catherine, who appeared absorbed in her household duties, must, however, have been thinking of the stories told by Zacharie about the head captain and the Pierron woman, for she half opened the front door and glanced outside.
Now the moment for action had come, and he cast a restless glance at the miners farther on. But a shadow blocked the gallery.
Although everything was in order in her house, and she scrubbed every Saturday, she glanced with a jealous housekeeper's eye over this clean room, in which there was even a certain coquetry, gilt vases on the sideboard, a mirror, three framed prints.
Pierronne was about to drink her coffee alone, all her people being at the pit.
I'm going to wash first; and just give me a hand to throw away this dirty water."
"Here! don't go and buy that ribbon at Maigrat's. He will rob you, and he will think that we are rolling in wealth."
She was trying, therefore, to put a good face on it, though with an anxious heart, as a housekeeper who was asking herself how she could make both ends meet now that the best part of her purse was going.
These forty-five francs helped the family and enabled them to make both ends meet, though always leaving some small debts and arrears; so the Maheus were grateful to their lodger; his linen was washed and mended, his buttons sewn on, and his affairs kept in order; in fact he felt all around him a woman's neatness and care.
If a married miner can with difficulty make both ends meet, a sober lad who has no burdens can even manage to save.
"Who is it?" he asked of Dansaert, who was standing in silence before the corpse which was being wrapped up in a sheet.
Among the men, Maheu was won over and shouted with anger, between Pierron who was trembling and Levaque who was talking too much; while the chaffers, Zacharie and Mouquet, though trying to make fun of things, were feeling uncomfortable and were surprised that their mate could talk on so long without having a drink.
And now you shall have a drink of it; yes, yes, like a beast, with your jaws in the trough!"
He knew that after the Montsou troubles there had been great excitement in the Paris journals, quite a violent controversy between the official newspapers and the opposition newspapers, terrible narratives, which were especially directed against the International, of which the empire was becoming afraid after having first encouraged it; and the directors not daring to turn a deaf ear any longer, two of them had condescended to come and hold an inquiry, but with an air of regret, not appearing to care about the upshot; so disinterested, that in three days they went away again, declaring that everything was going on as well as possible.
And what do they pay you in your house, your wife and the gentleman who is this minute wearing out her skin?"
Things did go on before these horrors.
Suddenly, a roar of thunder was heard, and a spout of fire darted out of the tube as from the mouth of a cannon charged with grapeshot.
Étienne would have died of inanition rather than beg a mouthful of bread from Chaval.
Then he cast a glance into the Port aux Vins as he went past, and after that counted the cabs coming from the station.
Then, all at once, with the clutch of a wild beast, he grasped the head of Therese in his two great hands, and by force brought her lips to the bite he had received from Camille on his neck.
At times, he could not prevent himself casting a side glance at the canvas; and, then, in the depth of the darkness, he still perceived the dull, deadened eyes of the drowned man.
Therese cast a deep, grave glance at him.
Not daring to move, they half blinded themselves staring at the scorching flames, and, when unable to resist any longer, they cast a timid glance aside, their eyes irritated by the glowing coal, created the vision, and conveyed to it a reddish glow.
When he had reached the studio, and had glanced at the canvases hanging against the walls, his astonishment redoubled.
Therese and Laurent rose from their chairs, terrified at this stroke, which had contorted the old mercer in less than five seconds.
The sinister truth, like a flash of flame, scorched the eyes of the paralysed woman and penetrated within her with the concussion of a shaft of lightning.
She knew right away that it wouId work between us, huh?
That's just like blanche
This package, for those who want, we can share it because it works in the garden, in a flower pot, with a lemon tree or a plant that you like.
You put a layer of 3 to 5 cm thick and it works !
Put our time to good use. Only trying to help, knobhead. Well, you're not.
You must be hot.
Don't worry, here you'll soon get back your color.
Oh, my God, it's working.
I will cut to the chase.
They just fell head over heels for me because I'm so hot!
Unless you want to be humiliated in front of your family, COME HERE RIGHT AWAY! So, you're saying you can't admit all the charges described here?
I'll be brief and to the point.
The last soul to die each year- the one who passes over at the stroke of midnight- is destined to be Death's driver for the following year.
I must see him turn over a new leaf!
It looks like we got it well in hand?
Now, here's a lot, folks. It doesn't look very big on top, but it's all yours as far down as you wanna go, and it's dirt cheap.
Do you know how to make the snail face?
"Embarrassing being stood up, isn't it?
Give us a hand there, men.
Mrs. Rittenhouse... Ever since I've met you, I've swept you off my feet.
If that works out, next year we could have an eight-cent nickel. Think what that would mean.
Johnson, come and give a hand.
Give me a hand here with this fella.
If everything goes well, you've got it made.
- No, can't a guy get up when he wants to without answering a lot of questions?
Tell Rico to look out.
If this works out, then I'll...
You just said we'd have to pinch nickels.
You should take a few lessons.
- Let's you and me have a drink.
But this is far from being a playground.
I'll have them take them off for you.
I'm looking for a couple of mugs.
You can say it was a real love match.
Or would you rather pass out here?
Better get us a lift, lunkhead, he's fainted.
Can't you give her a standup? Can I give her a standup?
what gave him the idea?
And if she makes good, it's $40 a week and her grub the first week.
I'll have my hands full tonight.
They're good boats.
How is it going?
How about giving me and my friend a handout?
Some of you boys give Bomber a hand.
She had a date with me and she's giving me a stand-up... and it's the first dame that ever gave me a stand-up.
You'd better have a little drink.
Don't you feel the need of a little drink?
Maudie, do you believe in love at first sight?
It'll come next time.
Well, anyway, the liquor was good.
Say, if I make this touch, I'm through.
With this outfit running away as it is, how am I going to get to Saigon?
Won't you come aboard and take a nip?
He's probably out losing his shirt at poker.
Let's see if this works.
I didn't figure on going this far. I didn't even think it would work.
"and lend a hand. "
"and lend a hand. "
I love you.
Let me turn the page, sister, please.
After you've given everything maybe something will come of it.
- Something's got to come of it.
- A lot of sleep'd done you more good.
Say, it's working!
But could you- could you use an extra hand... in your dairy business?
Belinha, I thought everything would work out for us but things are different down here in Brazil and I realize now that well, you never could belong to me.
If the little girl's not too bold, how's for me sticking with you to get it.
I knew we could do it!
Well, I've figured it out from every angle, kids. And I can't see how it'll run less than six months... or gross less than half a million.
How about going down to the drugstore and getting a drink?
You suggest I fold my tent and scram into the night?
If it works out well I'll be a famous singer.
You know, this is becoming irksome.
I'd hate to see him flop on the new job.
Isn't it like him?
Give us a hand.
Don't sit there looking at me. Do something to help me!
It'd be just about enough to barely keep her.
It works. Little Iras.
I knew that would do it.
It don't seem right for you to be carrying around them old heavy cans of syrup, peddling.
- Her mother all over again.
Chicken feed.
Slaving day in and day out to make both ends meet.
What's a loaf of bread anyway?
Say, she couldn't make a better choice, and she's a swell gal, and I hope you both click.
The ships that were once the means of building up the empire and of which this country depends for supplies would cease to exist.
It's awfully nice of you to come and tell me how she's getting on.
There's an old fellow at the club looks as much like me as I do.
Then he started making those awful faces... simply because he doesn't want me to mingle with what he calls riffraff... and that' s everybody in the world except us two.
He's cheap, like you, playing around with actresses.
I'll start up in business again. If I do well, I'll return.
How is the laundry business?
Stop that man!
The family cannot be broken up by a whim or a caprice or even by the sin of one of the partners in the marriage.
We can forget it. What do you say, brother?
I'll get Snowshoes to give us a hand.
Well, if that's all it is, you can sleep late tomorrow.
Be a good sport and help a fellow out.
Women like to be swept off their feet.
Here, Jan, give the doctor a hand.
I'm certainly getting enough of you fellas.
Thanks awfully. I say, do...do you believe in love at first sight?
Do you believe in love at first sight?
It's gonna be a sensation!
All right, how does it work?
Wouldn't it make Sheila happy if I could work this thing out?
We always do a pretty good business, you know.
Winners first! To your love life, kid.
It'd be a shame to bruise such pretty arms.
- What?
When I get it working, I'm gonna sell it to the government for plenty of dough.
If our show gets over, we'll pack them in.
Mr. Henrich says it's gonna catch on in the Bronx even better than Harlem.
If it keeps rolling in, you can quit the cabaret and move right into Park Avenue.
It sort of turned out better to toss it to the wolves, didn't it?
There's a screw loose somewhere.
Every time he came to Marseilles, he drank in the bar and watched you. Ange?
Would it be too much to ask you to give me a helping hand?
Well, you might help me.
They use words like "obligation" and "duty" to confuse you.
I can help out if you give me some money.
I only hope it's gonna work out all right.
I tell you, I'm getting heartily sick of Africa.
Do come back and tell me more.
-And everything is working well here?
Chee, if trade gets any better, I'll be rollin' around in di'monds and polls!
- He's captain Cedric all over again.
What are you trying to do, keel over?
Need some help?
- Come, Alf. Joe, come and give me a hand with this!
They're probably at home crying their eyes out.
Hey, you, give me a hand.
-You better have a drink, old man.
Women and me don't agree.
Now, if that's not the spitting image of Poppy, I'll eat my shirt.
I'm coming right down to cases.
I'm getting tired of this fiddling' around! Lawyers!

- You could give a helping hand, Bo.
I always tell you to watch it when you go out!
Aren't chemists good business?
His wife is about to take over the leadership of this union.
She says it works, just one key is a little off.
You seem to like beer?
I came because I was given a tip... but I doubt it'll work out.
ll is enough to pay to, one is more sensitive.
I'II cut your head off and stew it!
And if it all goes to plan, I figure that in a couple of years....
I don't care what your plans are.
I'll buy you a drink.
- And it works!
Such a bad weather, there was no one else around.
But your business is good now?
Okay that's fine.
How do you open it?
They would make a good couple
She may be dying.
Omar, you know how it works?
So why bother?
And it was 8 months for it.
Yes, we're doing fine.
I had a meeting near there so I had a drink afterwards
I´ll get to the point, sir.
But isn´t that how life goes?
Will you get to the point?
Give me a hand!
...love at first sight!
And are you doing all right?
Let's drink just a little bit, ok?
Hey, ...have you ...ever experienced love at first sight?
- I don't get it.
- Hey, it's not much.
I wanted to think things over
Water dripping, low sales, everything's provoking me, even you!
This place is wrong.
I adored her at first sight.
Come inside and get a little to eat and drink.
Let's see, if it works.
So this is how it works.
Something's not right.
We did it!
We get along fine like this.
It's a love-at-first-sight thing!
- I won. Easy, a snap.
Ca-can we just move on? This ==.
Wh-wh-wh-why does everybody have to move on so damn fast?
Richard wants this to work, so ...
You can't smell it. But it works.
W-well, what if it doesn't work out?
I don't think it'll work out, Louis.
I don't think it'll work out, Louis.
I don't think that'll work.
I have a problem with your lament on prioritizing sex as you're wearing a $2000 outfit designed to punctuate your contour looking like women in magazines except I can't turn the page.
With Bryan nothing chemical happened.
I'm not saying it would work for you or Ling, but...
Give you a hand!
Maybe it'll work.
OK, if this works, in about ten seconds you're gonna have one big burst of power.
It works because there's no guilt there's no torment, no consequences.
You must be tired from sleeping the last three days.
I'll help you. This isn't you.
How does it work?
Successful lawyer in a big law firm. Company car.
I don't know how it works.
So how does this work?
So how does this work?
- How does it work?
- It's gotta end.
- Only way it works is you kill me?
- You want backup, detective?
Should I be doing something?
You'd just better watch it! Or I'll be down your manor with all the other policemen!
Listen. I don't know what you're doing but it's working. He's getting shaky.
I'm just saying she'll work out.
I guess the old boy needed closure after all.
- Thumb! Necessary opposable thumb!
Well, if they do, I think we should do something.
- But how does it work?
The doctor spoke to me, and I should have told you.
D'you think that'll work with you?
You looked like you needed a break.
They're probably all with the smoochies right now.
While I'd love to go on trading jabs with you, Spike, perhaps I'll come to the point.
I was going to say perhaps you could use some backup. But now you mention it, gathering your strength might not be a bad idea.
And in the meantime, you are gonna stop torturing yourself.
It's how it works.
How will we know when it works?
This kid should be out playing Pop Warner.
What the hell's with this thing?
So I'm going to cut to the chase here, bud.
And, yes, I'm satisfied with that. Well, you've seen Cops, the TV show, right?
You know how this works, Brass.
Something is wrong, I know it.
And maybe if it works on them, it'll work on Williamson.
He needs to know what he's up against.
And if it works, then hopefully we'll find Dr Williamson.
Though I doubt it'll do any good.
Why isn't it working?
If we're ever gonna make this work, I think I deserve to know a little bit more about you, don't you think?
I've learned by now that if it walks like a duck and it quacks like a duck...
Help him to move on.
I'll always love Leo, in a certain way, for so many things, including helping me to move on.
If we do, it's binding. They can't even break that apart.
Because if things worked out, maybe you could stay.
Whitelighter or not, we can find a way to make this work.
I think it worked.
You know, I'm gonna come right out and say this, even if you get mad at me, but I know in my gut that something's not right with him.
You know how much I want this relationship to work.
We're desperate, and it's working.
- Because the only way it works is if you spread it over his bones, which happen to be buried.
I guess I better go find Prue some answers.
Okay, even if this works, we still have to find Belthazor.
I don't really understand how it all works myself.
But he's not even sure it's gonna work.
Well, whatever you call it, it's working.
That's what snapped you out of it.
That's not going to work.
I always thought it was because you were worried about your equipment.
- So what's this then?
I figured it out, it's working!
That's very good, that works.
I've never actually used it myself, but I think it works.
So, anytime you want to have it... you can have it.
But, anytime I want to have it, I can't.
-l'm happy to help out.
That's the way it comes out, my love.
Right now, she is probably out having the time of her life.
-You know what? I'm in.
Yeah, I'm- - All right, I'm in.
Well let me tell you how it does work, Jack.
Hey, you guys wanna come down and give us a hand?
Done.
How's the studying going?
-Yeah.
It worked.
Thanks for helping out tonight, honey.
You have to re-decide, over and over each day.
- No, she's just being Mother.
- Yeah. That works.
- Want me to give you a hand? - No.
You should be begging for forgiveness.
you know the game, President need Zo'or as an ally, and nothing else.
If this works... it's a new day.
Go help out in the childcare room.
Why do we even... weren't you trying to make it work with Amy?
Freezing in there.
It's that thing, you know what Dad always talks about, the thunderbolt.
Look, I don't know what I'm being, but we got a couple of days left. You wanna enjoy it or you wanna mope around?
All right, Ray, so maybe you can start giving me a hand around here now?
I'm gonna take the highroad and stick to the issues,
Something's not right.
How you doing?
This thing should be out hunting.
'Course, if it don't work... we get to keep your body.
It's not a lawyer's way to be long winded, so let's get right to the point.
Yes, it'll work.
My night vision's finally working!
Oh! Looks just like you!
I hope it all works out.
D'Argo, that's not how it works.
- Should we give you a hand?
What do you think ? Will it work ?
I'm trying... to help.
Let's go get a beer.
Um, would you mind showing me the ropes around here? Sure.
show you the ropes.
Hey, in the bedroom.
Well, it's definitely not gonna work If you're smoking weed.
Do you need a hand, sir?
No, it's not gonna work.
And that's why I got to stay alert.
I'm telling you, it sounds weird, but it works.
I think it's working.
But, you know, then I figure it has to work out.
Ross, you need some help?
Okay, look, Chandler, if this is gonna work... you have got to listen.
It's gonna freak me out!
I won't worry about this anymore then.
He's a really great guy, and I know you really want this to work out but I just don't see this having a future.
We should help them.
I really thought we'd be able to make it work.
how do you like me now?
It's not a career or anything, but it's got me solvent.
I shall be French, but I shall not be happy.
- I will never go near those filthy birds.
Come on, you asked for my help.
Yeah, and it's not the way I ever wanted to spend my time.
- Sounds great. This school is so different from Stars Hollow.
But you don't lose it in class. That's not part of the Rory personality description. If you're losing it in class... because you're tired, stressed out, or working too hard...
Don't lose heart. Make this work.
That's the way the system works.
Even if it does work, aren't you just going to be ruining your own couch?
You wouldn't turn off the t.V. For me, but you sure turned it off for Rico, didn't you?
I'm telling you, it works.
I just got an update from the union, and as your shop steward,
My soon-to-be ex calls me often with requests for money... and updates on the status of our uncoupling.
But I am getting really sick of the sarcastic remarks, Ray.
Maybe we could have the Transit guys help us out on this.
With Denny out of the picture we need to reassess our profile so I've asked Dr. Skoda here to lend us a hand.
We're capable of just lending a hand.
Benson just filled me in. You got anything new?
You could be making love on the floor!
If that doesn't work, I'm out of ideas.
Dewey, well, what about school?
Chief Justice Ginther, who was appointed by James Devlin, tends to turn a deaf ear to anything he considers
You want the crime, you've got to pay the dime.
All bullshit aside, Sister, I want God to pick me.
Oh, I sure hope this is gonna work.
Yeah. Well, you know, we like to stay on top of things.
Don't work that way.
Just make sure it works.
It'll work.
[Job] Hey, I'm gettin' somethin'.
That works.
Daddy, please. I just want Sydney to have some closure.
LET'S GO HAVE A DRINK.
I gotta help you out here.
That's how a relationship works.
It has to work.
If this works...
- Cool.
- So how does electricity work? - Why are you lookin' at me?
Allow me to get right to the point.
I don't think they've established that it works for women.
After I left the meeting I took a wrong turn and somehow found myself right back where I had started - back in New York, back wondering about Big.
I don't think it would work.
I can't believe guys still stand girls up.
I don't know how you raised your son, but he just stood me up for a date.
You can turn a corner, and boom - bright lights, date city.
I'll let you have this scarf if you show me where a girl can have a drink in a dark bar around here.
I have a crush. - Yeah?
Big wasn't a crush, he was a crash.
I haven't had a crush since Sean Cassidy. No way.
At this age I'd have to say I'm crush-proof.
I couldn't believe what my crush was saying.
If this is ever gonna work, I need you to believe in us.
I was completely ready to trade in my crush... Hi.
Maybe I'm sabotaging the relationship so I don't have to actually be happy.
- Because you don't want it to work.
Ladies, this is Ricky Fantucchi. He's a capricorn. His uncles are firefighters.
- Yeah, that works.
Hey, you gentiles are all right. [ Kisses ]
On any fucking scale you wanna use, things are going good.
I can do that standing on my head.
He wants you to know... ... thathewastherewith you and that you should move on.
These chinese kids are selling their teeth for peanuts, see?

Maybe we could try it; see how it goes.
See how it goes.
It's working!
So, I said to young Harry, "l'm not one for rainy days and gray skies."
He wants a rematch.
Feel like giving me a hand?
Shouldn't you be off sharpening your teeth?
I mean for us.
Then maybe you should be out doin' that. What do you think? Once again, I find myself feeling the need to apologise.
Damn it, this is not working.
That's how it works.
- I was so sure it would work.
I'm tellin' you, the only way to stop this loop... ..is to figure out how to run that stuff!
I gotta win her back... 'cause I can't stop the tears, man!
Well, I'm sorry, Kitty, but I think it's working.

Little drinks, I'm supposed to be having right now.
I put the hammer to farms in Concord, Salem, Laconia, Pelham, Hampton, Hudson.
- Yes, sir. 300,000 is an awfully large piece of troop movement to have been on a whim.

I think it will work.
I just thought it would work between you two.
I don't know how it works in a gay relationship.
but let me tell you how it works with me.
It's 9:45. Shouldn't she be at lunch?

And if that doesn't work, then I'll just find another place to live.
Ok, I will.
it works.
Proof it's working.
Will. you need to find some way to put this behind you.
- Oh, my God. It's working.
I mean, I mean, I love you, so if I can't make it work with you, then it'll never work with any woman, because you're perfect for me.
Come on. put that away and help me out.
I'm not attracted to you, so that line's not gonna work on me.
- You said it wouldn't work.
You ever get off your lazy ass to do anything but hassle me? !
We should be out there looking for it.
You think this is a dream?
If this plan is going to work I have to get to Austia before Eve's forces dig in.
-No, it's definitely working.

Donna, we will.
Oh, my God! It worked!
You're doing well, your mother was saying.
Wise old man, that's you.
If this doesn't work, leg it.
I'd just go for it, yeah?
Yeah, I really thought we'd be able to make it work.
All I did was give your uncle a little nudge out of the door.
- I need a hand over here!

Drix, I could use a little help here.
Give us food, and we'll be hungry tomorrow... but give us corn... the kind you plant, not eat... and we'll grow it... and uh, um... cut it... and, uh... you know, eat it.
Oh, my God.
It only works if you have every piece.
It'll work. It'll work if you-- if we stop playing games with each other.
You wasn 't saying that when you was smoking it.
You'll be the spittin' image of me
You saw how it works.
Love isn't like some enchanted evening... isn't a fairy tale... or even love at first sight.

And the sooner you learn it, the sooner you'll be able to protect yourself. - I have a power?
If it works, Belthazor will disappear, and Raynor won't be able to track me.
What makes you think that it will work?
You know, I still say we eliminate the threat first, kill Sutter.
- Hey, need a hand?
What you've got to understand about Harry, he's just had a big breakup. His self-esteem is not exactly peaking.
Jane, if that's you, could you once and for all just get over it?
Anyway, I don't recommend "actual" stalking. That's best left as a threat. You know, with your real unapproachables, like Loraine Kelly and Salman Rushdie.
- Susan probably needs a hand.
I'm sure you always lend a hand.
So, love at first sight, then?
She's probably undressing right now
Thanks. lt works at the galleries, you know.
No, I don't think it works like that. I don't know.
Something's not right here.
This is not the head. There's something wrong.
-l'm sorry, how's the show going?
I'm in analysis, it doesn't do anything.
Need a little assistance.
But I don't know how to work a video camera.
Why don't you make yourself useful and come and help us out with these bars?
- As long as it works.
So how does this bitch work?
So how does this bitch work?
- You're gonna need a hand.
I want this too, you know.
If they're smart like me, they're probably already on their way outta town.
Well, that's not been my experience.
But you're out, probably saving the world.
I'm not so sure that that would work out.
I'm sorry. We have to move on.
All of you should just move on.
- All right. Well, let me give you a hand.
- I just asked you to help her.
- Need any help? - Hey. Did you page me?
- Haleh, Medical Records needs help.
She needs help with her trinomials.
He made it seem like I ask him to help out with Reece all the time.
I just want to move on.
That's where you live now, so you better make it work.
Yeah. Don't be afraid to ask for help.
So she's a sweet girl. I'm trying to help.
Whatever works.
All right. You gotta help me out.
We had a little trouble with an aortic graft and I wanted a second pair of hands.
- He cut up his face. - You want some help?
Do you need help, Dave?
- I hope it's successful.
Let him walk right into the trap.
And I'm out of ideas, so... please Miss Palmer, help me out here.
So I guess we'll know if it works...
when it works.
Bottom line, ladies and gentleman we have a maniac orbiting Earth with enough fire power to pulverize our planet on a whim.
Have you learned how it works?
Maybe you give us a head start, okay?
So... is this the school system now?
Just give me a break. It's 8:00 in the morning.
I'll tell you this, you better watch out, 'cause...
- Whatever she's doing is working.
That's right, nevertheless-- and what are you doing?
Frank, are you helping?
That's now how it works, Ma.
And I need a little help, OK?
I just hope it goes OK.
Hey, Lois? I don't get how this works.
Do you want to give me a hand here? It's jammed.
The ship is shutting down!
Is something wrong?
I'm going to assist in the search.
It's working, working!
Moya must know that there is something seriously wrong with Pilot
Yeah. I'm gonna take the first ride on his ship when he figures it all out.
Well that we're in a crisis, hairdo, so you can either help, shut up, or go back to sleep.
That's the way it works, Harvey. You don't like it I could toss you back in the dumpster.
Just hope this works.
I could be killing him for all you know.
So, like, 3% of the time they don't even work?
Maybe it's time you let that stuff go.
Come on, Toby. Give me a hand!
I hope that won't work.
Phoebe, he's gotta be in the room for that to work.
- Catwoman, hands down. - Yeah.
We make sure not to get people's faces.
-And nagging works!
See? It works. I'm not angry at all anymore.
I'm sure Leela's tired of morons gaping at her eye all the time.
I simply want to find out how it's going.
It's far enough from the truth that it might work... but close enough to the truth... that I think I could negotiate a purgatory stint, if forced to.
But I guess it's time to move on.
He's probably parsing it right now.
I will be assisting and helping out those less fortunate than myself. I will be getting college credit, and this is the end of this conversation.
So she's sending him here, just like that?
Did you hear that Kimber Slately and Tristin are a major item?
You got backstage. Your eyes met across the crowd and you're seeing each other.
Okay, guys, talk to you later.
How's that x-ray vision coming?
I'm actually a little sick of her.
Sookie and I are going to start our own inn... and we've been searching for the perfect place.
We're gonna give it our best shot.
- And you know what? They work fine.
Or you get tired of waking up every day with those animals staring at you!
There's something seriously wrong with you.
Wait! Something is not right.
Why don't you give me a hand in case the sponge is... Up high.
Look at us? I mean, I could sit on you and kill you. Yet, we make it work.
We make fun of strangers, and damn it, it works!
A lot of lawyers do that with their alcoholic wives. It works.
Allen and Arthur on the same day, and it just hasn't really been working out and--and I feel like I need to make a choice.
I have colleagues, they have to be informed.
Everybody knows the game.
I bet the mother would like some closure.
We're not in Narcotics, you cowboy. Fast and loose doesn't play here.
I thought I'd have some closure... but it hasn't made a difference. Corrine is still afraid to go out and then my family is still in shambles.
Took us 50 years, but we finally figured out how it works.
I'm about to keel over.
Something's screwy.
I feel like I dropped the ball. How would you end the story?
and then the other one is helping him.
Come on. You're not seriously falling for that one, are you?
Okay. Deal
Stevie "need help?
I have a list of errands that need to be run.
-Why don't you give me a hand here.
Look, he must be having a simple, little dog dream.
- I'm saying the joke worked.
I know. Well, OK. Drinks at six.
You're taking the piss and I'm getting sick of it.
Okay. I can do that.
This approach might be working, and that would be wonderful, but only if we stick with it.
She needs us to set these boundaries, that's why it's working.
When you believe in something, you make it work.
Let me help you out.
Butter works just as well.
And it seems like it's not working.
It's always sad when things... don't work out that you want to work out and...
You must be exhausted.
They work fine.
And I know we would click.
Delancey, just help us out here, will you?
Oh God, oh God, this isn't working.
- You know, giving him a helping hand.
I wanna make sure that you grasp that I already grasped how things work around here.
- So lay this situation out for me.
Okay, but if that doesn't work, you might want to consider using your hostage as a shield.
- His is a cautionary tale.
HE'S SMART, HE'S FUNNY. HE...
SO THIS, UH, ARRANGEMENT'S WORKING OUT FOR YOU?
I MEAN, I ENCOURAGED YOU.
But, there is a silver lining to this gray cloud of prom disasters
Look, Isabel, this isn't the time to be making snap judgments about things. This is my life Max.
You know what? That's not gonna work, so look...
JESSE: Yeah, love at first sight.
She's helping me.
Show me how it works. All right.
-I figured you might need a little help.
Well, I'll help you out with that, then
And how's that working out for you?
Elliot is the only thing keeping me from losing my mind.
- Steve, I'm starting to hit my limit.
- How does it work?
- Apparently that's how it works.
Love at first sight.
I thought you two would hit it off.
How does that work?
That really covers the cat crap.
You should warn her.
Got it for a song too.
I asked him to help out.
Do you wanna show me how to play it?
- You need some help? - Yeah, sure.
- I'm gonna need a hand getting it home.
Okay, so how does it work?
And now it's time to put it to bed.
Oh, I get it, is this how it works?
You should've played that out.
This turned out to be a blessing in disguise.
How's that going?
- You could use some help.
The big man! Come have drink.
Nah, see, something's wrong, i'm not laughing.
You see, my friend Stan here is an over-sensitive animal lover.
'We get the Tube into Soho 'and go for drinks in a fashionable gay bar, 'before catching a play by a hip playwright, 'preferably with a swearword in the title.
What the hell do you think you're doing ?
Whoever lived here must have been studying it.
Aha.
Give me a hand.
If Seven's idea works, Tuvok and those other crewmen will be fine.
Oh, that. Not workin' out, is it? Gosh, I wish I'd seen that comin'.

If it works, we could wipe out a significant part of Apophis's fleet in one shot.

Yeah, well, that's Colonel OK.'Neill for you.
We've never dialled these coordinates.
If successful, it would deal the Goa'uld a mortal blow.
If we pull this off, the Goa'uld may never recover.
So you know it works?
Yeah. So is it working? Has he said anything?
Kitty, you wanna give me a hand?
- Would you watch it!
They know it won't break.
You'd think it would go both ways, but it doesn't.
And second of all, if I did, it would so work.
I-I-it's working. And it's a little bit better.
And I guess I'm ready to take this risk.
Then you get a swinging light bulb in there and just do it.
Well, I'm a straight shooter.
I'm sorry, how does a telephone work again?
It's all right. I'm sorry to be abrupt, but I'm racing the clock a Iittle.
A lightning bolt, a key and a kite.
- And they're all right?
- I heard you need help.
Well, I can't make you Thailand's ambassador to the U.S...
AII right. -How was the trip?
-I'm pushing you because it works.
Tell me how it works.
- Make this happen.
What are you doing? It's freezing out here.
It's easier to sell out the Western states you won't win anyway than to help cattlemen whose prices are plummeting.
Well now this really needs to work.
- No, I don't. See how that works?
No, I don't think it's gonna work out, anyway.
Listen, I got your message about Thanksgiving and you can count me in
- Flatsy Patsy.
I just wanted to say that I hope this is working out. lt's important to your mom.
Something's wrong. Something doesn't make any sense.
I'm aware how pheromones work.
I could be dyin' in here for all she knows.
It may not be the best way, but it's one way to catch an escaped convict.
I obviously haven't been able to rely on those whose job it is to keep me apprised and informed.

Ya know what? I'm cookin' in here. I need som'in' to wet my whistle.

Can you give me a hand here?
- Fear not, for I shall assist ye!
I told you it would work.

I guess for this to work we have to be touching each other.
I got the kind, daffy fucking bud, man... the hydro nuggety-nugs... red fiber... herbal medications sweep upon the nation.
Pilot, I'm really sorry about what happened back there. Man, I thought those guys were down.

That's how the stories always go...
They probably looking for me... right about now, so... you know...
Well, if I awoke and there was the smell... of grits and eggs... or water steaming off the pavement... as she hosed it down... I had to look out all day.
So, did you come back for that drink?
I lend a hand .
It takes all three for their predictive abilities to work.

I was the one tried to help you.
- Sex is still good?
Call it "the lightning bolt," call it a connection, destiny, whatever.
And how's that working out so far?
I'll give you a little hand here.
But the truth is there isn't a lightning bolt to slap you on the ass and tell you to pick this person over all others.
You know the drill.
I know how hard it is to find closure.
Even if I could... Even if I could make it through, what guarantee is there it would accomplish anything, anything would be different?

There's something wrong with him.
Does it really work?
That's not the way it should be.

- I really want to make this work.

Thomas Hardy.
You sure that thing works?
It's just the way it works.
Shouldn't you be off peeling Paige a grape or something?
Look, if it works on me, it's gonna work on him, right?

I'm glad it's going well.
We should be playing golf.
We are really zipping along here.
- Okay, wait. Done deal.
How's the filming going?
Come on, they fit me.
What is it like to take someone's soul?
I think for this to work you two need to be a little less honest with each other.
But that's not the way things work.
I let my ego and pride get in the way.
You and i know how it is, mr. Swearengen.
Any figure I would've come up with, part of that you give to him to gamble or piss away however else he's gonna do it.
He, uh... must be sleeping in.
Sorry you had to listen to them drunken fools before, mr. Hickok. When you and mr.
- No. Let's drink. - (laughs)

- Need any help?
Yeah, just like his daddy.
No. - Do you need a hand in here?
As long as you're here, maybe you can give me a hand.
Think you can stick around for a few minutes, give me a hand?
I guess you don't want this one to work out either.
Just tell me the deal's done.
I'm starting to see how this business works.
You're telling me you're willing to fuck up our friendship... 'cause if this doesn't work out, there's no turning back.
- 'Cause that ain't how it works, asshole.
Rufus, that's how he does it.
If he falls out, you think of me, right?
'Cause my man, E., here just got his heart broken.
We're gonna open huge.
'Cause I knew you'd fuck me, you prick!
No, it's not. I'm glad it worked out with you two.
That's-that's the way it works with friends.
I don't care how it works.
I'm not gonna allow you to-to drive all the way out there on a lark.
-I don't think it works that way.
I know, dude. It's so on.
Because I didn't want to get into it with you.
I want this to work and I'll do whatever I can gladly.
Are you gonna get all pissy again when filling it out?
That's how it works in high school.
Oh, yeah, did I mention? employees get to eat for free even when they're not workin' and Mikey says I get to pick up dinner shiftsfrom now on so I get to sleep in.
Somehow I always knew that part would work itself out.
I don't think it's working.
So, if you think this isn't working out, then maybe we should just stop.
I don't think it works that way, Ephram.
Trust me, it works.
I mean... why would you put yourself through all of this if you... -if you-if you didn't think it would work?
Come on, sweetie. I need your help.
I thought those two were gonna duke it out all weekend.
Well... well, it works the other way too, right?
Yeah, the cookie lady-- she beat the chips out of you!
Yeah, how's that goin'?
This is what we do.
Barbara fell enchanted vith you in a picture in People magazine
We could twist up a fatty and turn this mother out.
You have a crush on her because she's the first woman that was ever nice to you.
I know things could still go wrong, but if they don't if this works out, we're gonna have a baby.
Okay, well I won't uh, worry about this anymore then.
'And I had to help the temp who was probably doing some filing or data entry.
Let's just say I'm window shopping, and there's a half-price sale on weird.

- My accompanist just passed out.
Mom's in a relationship now, and she's doing really great.

It was love at first sight.
This is not how it's done.
Kirk, I just had a spat with my sourball distributor, and I'm not in the mood.
Cheese works, this is a turning point.
- I'll try to refrain.
Maybe it'll work this time.
How long before we know if it's working?
And my doctor said I might not get any periods at all if it was working. Interestingly enough, you also don't get any periods if it isn't working, which is why you were supposed to get regular pregnancy tests.
We'll know in 24 hours if it's working.
Yeah, well, that's the way it works.
It was quicker running the test than arguing with you.
Where I come from, if it works-- Yeah, right.
I was gonna say leave, but that works.
The fact is, your Mom's gonna have an extra drink every now and then.
- Do you believe in love at first sight?
That's how this thing works.
I mean, you've seen how it works.
Okay, I'm in.
So far, it's working out.
Can you give me a hand with this?
I can punt you outta here on a whim.
I--I need a beverage.
Angela - I'm still trying to figure it out.
Look, Adam, you've got to get on board with this if we're gonna hang.
Yeah, you're on.
Do you want a drink?
We're just trying to live vicariously.
Besides, we shouldn't be talking about death.
Will... how can you possibly think this could ever work out?
That's the way it works nowadays.
I think the fact that it's so acceptable is a real embarrassment.
And I'm willing to do whatever it takes to make this work.
You look like you could use a hand there.
If I was, would it work?
If it was, would it work?
All right, here's how it works.
I'll cut to the chase.
Look, Gina, I know he's your baby, but it's time to move on.
Oh, I want to, but last time I checked, you really needed sperm to make it worthwhile.
No he's not, we're friends, he helps me out with stuff.
Appeal to their vanity. Works every time.
- All right, I'm gonna call you about that.
You guys need help cleaning up?
How about dinner and a movie for 500 pounds of Pacific salmon?
You'd be surprised how well it works.

So... how does it work?
You guys need a hand?
What we're doing, chasing some phantom distress signal, what are the odds of this working?
Sorry, I don't understand, but you're cool with this, right?
You! Come on! Come over here!
And it works all the time
Couldn't draw the face but it's self-explanatory.
It runs on stupidity.
If we close this case, we can call city hall, we can call the press, we're going to have juice. Come on, you know how this works.
When I say "wipe," you give me a handwipe. That's how it works.

Well, I told you, it was love at first sight.
You need a hand?
You know, if this works, Abs, you're a genius.
Okay. You're on, baby! You're on!
NCIS doesn't work out, I hear General Wee's Chinese Restaurant's hiring.
Drugs are always a safe bet.
Must have been some girl, Petty Officer Wong.
How does it work?
Why would showing up in person do the trick... when leaving five messages didn't?
I thought maybe it would bring her some sense of peace, some closure.
If it works out with Ava and you find a cool job that you love in Gay Paree...
Something don't feel right, Doc.
I'll tell you what. Why don't you come in and help for a week... and see how it strikes you?
It can't look pretty, it's gotta work.
Maybe you could help me with him.
And this, anti-aging diet really works?
They try a new diet for a week, and then when it doesn't work... they think lipo can solve all their problems.

-Or just too dysfunctional together to make it work.
That's kind of how it works.
She's supposed to be crying and he's supposed to be brooding.
- That's how it works.
You must be talking about Lindsay, not Alex, the one I... made out with.
Although, at Camp Tokaho, I was often referred to as a girl so I guess it works either way.
I want to make this work between us.
Yeah, well that's the way it's been going for me lately.
We can make this work as a family.
Even if we could be together, what makes you think it would work?
Do you need a hand?
It's important to Lucas so I like to try and keep up.
I'm just helping out.
Look, I like to be with you too, but the real Haley, the one that I got all crushed out on, you know?
I'll help out at the dealership till you... get back on your feet.
You wanna help me with this table?
I knew you would.
But I guess this time I'm just going to have to tell them that... once in a while, we could all use a little help, and... they're just going to have to swallow their fucking pride and... say... thank you.
Can I give you a hand?
It's not his mother who's gone around the bend.
I'll cancel my shift tonight. I'll lend you a hand.
Oh, is that how it works?
Well, I was thinking at work today, why don't we do another commercial and get another new car?

What are the chances of it working?
I really hope this works.
- It looks that's work, see? .
I can see that working.
It doesn't quite work like that.

I suppose what I'm really looking for is a bit of womanly advice.
So what is it?

You think she's either setting you up or there's something wrong with her.
That's how it works.
How's a person supposed to get past something like this?
- Is that how it works?
Give me a hand with this, would you, Joan?
Can we cut to the chase?
Can we just get to it?
The point is, they had way more going for them in terms of compatibility and they're over, which just, you know, makes you think.
Ooh, I'm in.
How does that work?
How did you know that would work?
I don't know if that would work, but I guess it's worth a shot.
This is actually working.
Long drawn-out good-bye it is.
That's weird. It works for me.
I hope this works out.
- That really works?

Hey, Joey, would you give us a hand with the girls?
Well, is there any chance you'd want to have drinks?

If you - if you heard this tape or this conversation, then you know exactly what I said, and I said that it is fun and easy to be with you, that I want to make it work with you.
If things go well with Arianna, maybe you can get some film clients.

So how's everything with Jake?
I mean, he could be pushing her away.
Let her try. She's probably already in the process of doin' it.
He promised us that it would work.

- Let me tell you how this works, okay?
I don't know how it works,but...

Could you give me a hand, darling?
Just tell me how this works.

I'm in here packing for my family to go to a wedding, and I keep thinking I should be out there searching for her.
Then I need you to call me back and let me know that you got through.
Okay, look, this is how it works:
What do you think you're doing?
- What do you think you're doing right now, huh?
About 6 years ago, I was out drinking, when I met this little firecracker.
I'm here to make things right, though, so if you give me a hand we can load this beer into your car and I'll be on my way.
I'm telling you, this karma stuff works.
Man, this karma stuff just don't work on me.
Randy, it doesn't work like that.
See, it doesn't work.
She could have been in the vomiting position when she was attacked.

You want to give me a hand?
I'll give her a hand with that.
I trust... that you will keep me informed.
And does it work?
All right, it's looking good.
Well, it's prohibitively expensive and rarely works.
Well, you're the one who said you were sick of observing.
The expression is taking a hike.
I'm going to go postal!
I better go rescue Gina.
If were going to make this work, you're going to have to let me help you, Julia.
We both want to do what it takes to be successful, and I just want to make sure that when we get there, there aren't any raised eyebrows.
I wanted things to work so bad.
You think it's working?
Been wanting to see how it works.
So set it up.
You need a hand?
Sagamore is gonna have our heads.
It works every time.
We should see if we can get the whiz kid in here to give us a hand.

So he'll probably be tapping the girlfriend by now.
Come on, Don,you know how it works:
If it works, we have a whole new system for analyzing and investigating serial crime.

So how does this work?
The can has an internal heating system.
Hey, Charlie, you know I could use a hand getting the yard ready for the wedding.
So how would that work, Dad?
This guy got tired of waiting for us to figure out what he was trying to say.
Doesn't there?
I'm gonna sleep in all week.
Meanwhile you could be doing something fun.
Is that how it works with you and Summer?
I'll just be sleeping.
You must have been talking to Marissa.
I really wanted this to work between us.
Why are we kidding ourselves here, Ry?
Like give up comics, stop mumbling. You don't do any of that.
By the time we get back something else will have exploded to make this whole thing look silly.
- So, it's on.
If we push hard and it doesn't work, we'll have ourselves to blame.
It is working; that's why you're not waiting.
It's liberal, it's turtleneck weather, and most importantly, it's 3,000 miles away from here.
Well, then I'll get right to it.
Summer, I'm trying to make this work.
If that doesn't work, I'll buy dinner.

But this is the only family we have. I really want it to work.
We're talking about hanging out next week, get some drinks.
Seems like things are going pretty good, right?
They think it could be really hot right now.
Otherwise, I have no shot at taking back this carnival.
It's 2005, you know how these things work.
If my taking over the company threatens any of the progress you've made...
I think this is going great.
- Hey ya, may I help you on here ?
Sure you don't want me to help you with that ?
Hey I have an idea, you know that extra bedroom, if the all girlfriend thing never happens,
All right, well let me show you how it's done.
Soso that's the way it's done.
Yeah, that was a joke, that was actually my brother's, it was supposed to be with bills and doesn't work great with faxes.
You know you should come with us, because you know we are going out and it could be a good chance for you to see what people are like outside the office, I think it could be fun
Guys, wondering if I could get your help for something.
If they offer a course in making ends meet.
How's that work?
And you two are either gonna make this work or tear it down!
How does it work?
Brooke, it'll probably never happen.

Whatever it takes to make it work. Saturday won't work. Whatever it takes to make it work.
Can I get a hand with this, please?
I must've been working. I must've been working.
Not that there's a damn thing wrong with them.
I mean, if they can't make it, who can.
Well, you know, this is not a spur-of-the-moment kind of a thing.
All right.
I'm losing my mind out here. You know, Staten Island--
I just really wanna pull over and have a couple of drinks.
Here, I'll help you look for it.

He needed a helping hand.

Well, that's the only way this works.
Yeah, well, they're angry because it's working.
Guess I gotta grab me a 40 and go pay my respects.
You need to get past it.
We should just end this, say it isn't working.
I could use some... closure.
What do you need from him to make this work?
Can you turn the page for me?
So would someone give me a call and let me know-
That was my father.
And I hope and pray that you put everything... everything behind us and let me help you, because I know you're gonna need it.
Hey, can you help me with something?
I was expecting you to try to make this work.

Now, show me exactly how this works.
Well, let's hope it works.
You took a risk, a hell of a fuckin' risk, And you could have been eating shit right now, But instead, you're basking in glory.
How's that working for you?
I suppose it does work on some level. Thank you.
So bring henry back And we'll do the rest to make it work.

You're gonna figure out how to do this... and hopefully it's before your new little girl arrives.

We could be talking crusade here.
But I'm sure Jackson will get to the bottom of it.
Well let me sit here and state the obvious.
Assuming it actually does work..
Well this better be quick, cos 45 minutes away from your girlfriend, you're gonna turn into a pumpkin and I'm gonna have to haul your ass back there.
- Is it working?
- Well of course it worked!
I'm surprised it works.
Aye, that would work.
How's it coming?
So I guess we'll just keep in touch, then?
Just because it works in simulation doesn't mean ...
(Just in case this doesn't work.)
Through a greater understanding... of the long-term effects of severe ozone depletion on plant life.
Come over and give me a hand.
And I can tell you, I can feel it working!
- Pull this off, I'll buy you a drink.
Rodney, it works.
You know, if this works, somebody might have to do it again.
We still have no idea how it works, but during the Wraith feeding process, the victim is injected with a special enzyme.
I don't think it would work, even if we tried.
I think we have it.
If you're gonna con someone, you've got to get inside their heads.
Yes, I know how it works.
They're so wrong but it works.
So you can make it, then ?
I'm serious. You've got to be careful.
Dad could be in trouble. We should be looking for him.
I don't think that's gonna work.
The problem is I could be sleeping in a bed right now.
Let me explain how this works.
It could be takin' in water.
We have to make this work.
Just get over here and give us a hand, would you, buddy?
Yeah, but I don't believe I can, so this is nothing like that.
And it totally worked !
Are you sure this is for neck pain?
And it's working.
And if that doesn't work, you can just have a kid.
Who gets married on a whim anyway ?
And if it doesn't work out between you and Kelso, it'll loosen you up.
- Well,how does it work?
The signal made from the chips he stole... how did it work?
I'll bring up somebody from security to give you a hand.
When you see that it works, we're gonna do up to a hundred dimes a week.
My brother left here and changed his ways. He cleaned up.
Dad, why did you ask Harrison to step outside?
It was the last thing he ever painted. I majored in art history. And my first big crush was on Robert Vander Krawl.
He's looking at, like, eight years. - So, what, you came just to hang out and get faced or what?
Under control. Got a tip from Admiral McNulty, Fifth Fleet.
Hey, it actually works.
I have to struggle to make ends meet, and you can buy a Porsche?
We don't need to do the bypass.
Oh, well, you could've picked up a phone and given me a heads up.
You should be out finding Lilly's killer, not grilling me.
All right, brother, prepare to be helped out.
So how is it you're going to find, uh, and I really hate to use this word but it is appropriate...closure?
Are you willing to put $250 into some strange locker just to see if this works?
I'm gonna give her a hand.
My go-to temptress just canceled on me, and I need an A.V. Wizard to be my eyes and ears for a scenario
Trina is family. I'm helping her out.
Oh, this is so Caz, totally immature.
It works, see?
Chairs, for sitting, uh, the phone in case you need to make a call, would be... just like that.
Ah, Veronica... this is really grasping at straws.
Maybe you can learn from her mistake.
If you want this little arrangement to work, try not to patronize me.
So who's supposed to help me out, then?
Honey, it works.
I know how it works.
Say, bud, can you give me a spot?
"Catherine, thank you for the good days, but I need to move on.
- And that line works?
Yeah, well, somebody's poking somebody!
You know, you do tend to get a little spacey.
Come on, that's how that works around here.
Thanks for lending a hand.
But no, she's jumping there before she even know the lay of the land.
I'm doing what we practiced and I think it's working.
Isn't that the way it works around here?
It's a cool move if it works.
Give me a hand.
I know how to make this work, but you have to let me.
And hopefully, we're about to put that all behind us.
We just have to accept it and move on.
Okay, I'll do it It's only because it gives me an actual excuse not to go to your father's birthday party
Most people never get any closure I got hot closure
- No, no, no, it's just that-- In case things work out with us one day I could give it to you as a memento from our first date
You want me to help you?
Dr. Hill, still propping up DI Jordan?
Well, he liked to go out for a drink after work but that's pretty big even for him.
You know the way this works.
Yeah, that'll work.
Hey, listen, if you need a hand with this, I'm available.
You should watch your back.
I'm not gonna put up with this.
Oh, God. Just back off, all of you.
Aiden was really into Spencer when she was a new girl, but...
- Right. But it's in their interests to say you said it because ifthey don't, they're not gonna get what you say tomorrow or the next day when I decide to tell them what it is you're saying.
Dude, this is going awesome.
Dude, I think it's totally working.
Now look, Butters, when the girls bring out the future-telling device, pay attention to how it works
Come on in the auditing room and I'll show you how it works.
The strategy was to only bring fire and it's working so far.
We've got everything we need.
Yes, it's working!

"Do you wanna be a part of my family?"
Ooh, she'll go nuts.
How does it work?
- Oh. Any luck?
All right, Manny, great.
The least you can do is have a drink with me.
I can turn the page now.
You do not think a girl can not blow a cable?
TELLING ME HOW CAN THEY HELP. MEANWHILE, I SOLD MY CAR TO TRY TO MAKE THE ENDS MEET.
I'm sure they're on their way back.
- Ain't leaving my house for nothing. Not in a hundred years!
Oh, I think I'm in love with you.
Like standing up a fit girl I could have a decent chat with... and a snog for a slapper who treated me like shit and only snogged me to turn on the loser guys.
You work with this system?
it'd have felt I could pick the place up cheap.
All right: "School and Soccer"
Cool! Maybe you could help us here.
This is how it works.
If they start bombing the place, there's no telling what will happen.
That's an arranged "Love at first sight".
"Love at first sight" ?
"Love at first sight" is feeling the true love, like a shock.
That was the real "Love at first sight".
"Love at first sight" ?
To experience love at first sight, is to feel true love.
You are under arrest for having a damn good time.
Someone who doesn't know how this city works.
Well, then, get yourself back into a program and make it stick this time.
How do I know when it works?
How do I know when it works?
That ever work?
- Yeah, sure, Lou.
There's something... Loose here... and if we hang around...
Do you really want to be the family head that much?
- Thought there was like fit birds...
I thought we'd had our chips!
Bubba, give me a hand!
He's not in the loop, he doesn't know how it works.
By the grace of God!
Just like his Grandpa!
That's my daughter, just like her mother...
How is this working?
The problem is, I've already asked the Great Goddess of the Forest for so many miracles... I'm afraid she might get mad!
You'll only go batshit.
That's typical from Sylvain.
If I qualify, forget this gutter.
Wait. See if this works.
Your son probably has internal bleeding.
I'm not saying turn the page, but I don't see why you always celebrate this morbid anniversary.
I heard that Marvin needed some help, so I figured, why not?
Beats me, but it works.
I don't know if this kind of therapy is working for me.
And I kissed her- And I think she kissed me back, but I'm not sure... 'cause I never kissed a girl before, and I'm not sure what the rules are.
How's that goin'?
I don't know why it works.
Not if it works.
If the demon wants you, it will.
Why not? Oh, come on. The only way this is gonna work is if we keep it quiet.
We could go out and have a drink.
- Uh-- Goddamn, how does this time travel work?

Come here, Isabelle.
"Think about your audience." He's gotta be joking.
Hey, I... I'm sorry. I just don't like it when people grope my body and I have to watch out for that because I snort so much coke.
- Reverse throwing!
Don't you know how things are run up there?
Run up there like they're run down here.
Then what? What's next when that doesn't work?
'Cause that's how it's done.
Yeah. You can't trust a guy who acts like he's got nothing to lose.
If your father were alive and saw you here sitting with me, let's say he'd have a word with me about this.
How many of these guys have you been with you long enough to be disgruntled, huh?
like anything that could help us?
I'm fucking Irish, I'll deal with somethin' being wrong for the rest of my life.
This computer is getting all friggin' bluey on me.

The med students will help you out with scutwork.
I remember she tried to make it work here with us with him.

- We told you not to break that egg.
- Yep. Typical rat.
- So, you think this might work?
Come on, we're getting off track here.
No, I said watch the boxes.
I don't know if it's gonna work.
Delia, could you give me a hand with this, please?
- That's how we do business in this town.

And I don't need to tell you to be careful.
Why don't you go chase a couple of drinks while me and the boys chew the fat?
Let me help you with that, my friend.
Love at first sight?

Right.
Please work. Please work. Please work!
What the fuck's salt gonna do?
- But musically, how does it work?

So, how are the wheels of commerce turning today?
I wanna help you.
"Okay." Clever, could go either way.
Maybe the guy's taking a shit.
- Don't even think about standing me up. - Okay.
I mean, relationships, they either work, or they don't.
What's weird is we haven't been in the same room together for years and the best we can do for Dev
Take your time. I wouldn't want you making another snap decision.
You're gonna stand up my aunt?
I can't keep track of all those who come here to call

- Two mojitos coming up!
A woman who's helping me.
Raise your ass and spin me a helping hand.

I fell in love at once.
How does this start?
Right, shouldn't you be climbing into some smoking hole in the ground?
-Sure thing.
We will accompany this man ties the main street there the telephone will work.
Because instead of a panic-stricken spray-and-pray response they're actually hitting the target.
It tastes like cat pee.
It was just to help out.
Decided to check out early.
I don't understand how they do it.
-All right, need a favor.
Kaller, give me a hand with them!
This place is about to explode.
Now, would you come on over and help me?
Hey, can I get some help up here?
We should be runnin' now!
The girl needs a short, right?
Listen, I'm going 'on top of a hill with some friends after work. We'll drink a few beers, we will relax and watch the sunset.
I was nearby and I wondered if the event could serve you a hand.
To drink, silly.
When you need of a hand.
Why 'do not give me a hand?
But at least some of us are smart enough to take precautions.
Of course, you won't be earning but Jacob here volunteered to carry you girls on the cuff till things have settled down.
As long as it's on the cuff and not on my back.
No, I think that it worked. I think that it worked.
Something's wrong!
Why isn't this working?
These things haven't seemed right from the beginning.
You know, about how you saw him at the hotel and it was love at first sight! And what a catch you are. How it's about time you found yourself a nice boyfriend!
- Oh, my god! News of my crush has just travelled across the Atlantic Ocean!
I'll just... ive you a hand!
I can't believe you said 'I'll give you a hand! '
You see, I was so caught up in my own head. I missed out on getting to know you.
You know how this thing works.
Hey, pigeon handler, give us a hand!
You can start by coming home and helping me with Dad.
You want to give me a spot?
Yeah, Danny, that's how it usually works.
[Larry] Danny, you know, i know what it's like to get dumped.
No bolts of lightning.
You ever think about trying to miss, Beagle? You might do better.
What?
they tried some ways then, they gave you some pills and then... have new side effect.
We're gonna go get a drink.
Show her how it's done!
So are you gonna move or do my friends have to move you for me?
Now with his parole hearing just around the bend, it looks like he might be taking his balls and going home.
Trust me, that'll do the trick.
Yeah. Trust me, that'll do the trick.
You see? Now he could've got straight to the point. But he wants us to live an adventure.
I bet you that's worth a few bob.
You think this will work?
If you knew what I went through... the pressures I was under, the deadlines... you wouldn't begrudge me a fuckin' drink.
What is with you, you're getting a drink, you don't invite me, I go away for 8 years and all of a sudden I'm an outcast?
Hey Sue, I'm thinkin' about going to Dez's for a couple of beers tonight, if thas all right?
Well, if you can crush John like you crushed Molly... I think we got it,
Look, I've... never done this before, so... I'm not exactly sure how it goes,
And it works, dude!
Help a sister out.
O2: Something ain't right.
Perhaps... he decided to leave on the spur of the moment.
What a bore! The Holy Emperor would have rewarded well for that brat!
Are you saying that you killed because you Soga has dominated a moment of anger?
I should be flossing molars for a living.
Would that work?
I came here on a stupid whim.
It's freezing, and...
That's what happens when you start doing well at work, darling.
A little Crisco and some fishing line, and we're in business.
- Well, it's definitely working.
Nobody's supposed to know about it, but I saw him mailing off a bunch of Senor Tomato figurines.
Want something to drink?
I'm running short.
He's helping with the exhibition.
Give me a hand.
Migue, do me a favor, help lván unload.
Maybe you'll make it this time. Listen carefully, here it comes:
He checks out the prison, follows the pathetic teacher into her pathetic apartment and opens his fat wallet.
They're just for support.
Listen, I'll come right to the point.
Cliff, that's gonna work.
I promise you, I will make this work.
I will make this work. I promise.
- It's typical Howard Hughes.
Looks like I need some help.
- He's gonna help me with my boat.
AMANDA: Yeah, you know how it is. I think I can do some good, maybe volunteer for five hours a week.
You don't understand. I'm here because I need your help.
Will you snap out of it?
If this situation's gonna work, we've got to be honest with each other.
Have you ever done one stupid, passionate spontaneous thing in your whole life?
I've waited for somebody just like you to have you wrapped around my finger.
It's not right
Wonder if it works 20,000 ryo is fantastic...
But if we pull it off, we'll get at least 100 ryo 100 ryo!
God, we've got a long way to go.
When I'm sure it's working, he'll get paid.
Do you believe in love at first sight?
He wanna get down. He gonna get his drunk on, see?
I mean, this is him.
Let me know how it turns out.
You can't kill people on a whim.
It's worked for centuries.
Maybe she's got cold feet 'cause she knows it's not right between the two of you.
I don't know what else is in the skull so, Preston, please tell me it's gonna work.
And he's making moves.
How does it work?
We were basically just chilling out. And we were just getting pissed off because we're not doing anything.
You know, it works for some people.
So it works for some people, right?
You want a drink?
Motherfucker, do you want a drink? I mean, are you thirsty?
How typical of you.
See if it works.
How does it work?
You end up in some dead-end job trying to make ends meet.
Maybe Jaime can pick up on it.
Every schmuck I know, selling tampons to tobacco, thinks this shit works.
I just need a little shove in the back.
I should be packing for Jamaica this very fucking minute!
That's exactly what you need to make your world work,
Maybe not so artistic, but it works,
Okay, I think I got it.
That's how it works.
Classic Dan.
Hey, you gotta be careful.
If this works, I'm sending your mother a check.
- Do you want a drink?
April, darling, do you want a drink?
Fancy giving me a hand next Saturday?
I felt as if I was struck by lightning.
I suppose that works, but some days I go...
Yo, Tech, it's on.
- And if I don't?
And if that don't pan out?
All right, you're on.
There's only one way this is gonna work
It's freezing in here.
That's typical of you, always on the outside looking in.
Oh, shit. I got it.
He ought to watch that. Could get a nasty infection.
Sold for cheap a long time ago.
I bet 20 against you.
Go closer. Do it right.
They're basically in charge of standing around the lobby with their dicks in their hands, you know what I mean?
I bet you your dick is disintegrating as we speak, player!
Well, let's get on it, then.
This is not happening to me.
All this is not my cup of tea!
The only way it's gonna work is if it doesn't matter.
We don't do anything else than look at appartments anymore.
If it works, it is right. If it doesn't work, it is wrong.
We follow our ancestors' rules because they work.
- And is it working?
- Oh, yeah, It's better.
It works every time.
Give Rose a hand in the meantime.
Love at first sight.
- Francis needs a hand.
It's good, you have to add spice to yoru relationship.
If it works, i'm going to spend my life with her.
Thanks. We know how it works.
Why shouldn't it fly?
But your arrogant behavior is an insult to my intelligence.
-You want to give me a hand with this?
Give me a hand, or are you going to stand there?
I'll tell you if I get it but I doubt it.
See? Εven in English, works like a charm.
All I want from you is to take this squarehead to the airport.
- How does this work?
So, how are things working out at the Barn?
I think he's plumb sauced, he is.
Penelope, I'm not quite sure how this works.
I own some of the producer's stock. It makes me good money.
I know what he's trying to do, and it's not gonna work.
I come here to give you a hand! I've put drugs in their wine!
Could I possibly help out at the diner?
I don't think it's working.
I just help out.
Yes, I'm helping out.
Can I continue to help out here?
- Something's wrong.
You know how that goes.
Give me a hand here.
We can not be hiding from each other all day. No
Don't look at me like that..
Something's not right.
I've done the math, it doesn't match!
It doesn't fit!
Sure, pals come first!
I'm helping you. We haven't a second to lose.
If it doesn't work, I'll look fucking lame.
Otherwise it doesn't work.
Trust me, this will work.
In there, you gotta watch your back 24/7, and your ass.
It's a magical place where you can eat what you want, and you can sleep in and have ice cream and cheeseburgers and candy and...
then I'm gonna have to find a dream big enough that does.
We're just gonna go crazy sitting here in one spot.
But we'lI make love every night in case it works someday.
That's not how it works, sweetie.
I changed the Performing Tomato. It works fine. They loved it.
If it works out, the contract's 6 months, renewable.
- Got to be careful.
Van Bourke we need your help.
It'll work wonders.
How does it go without gas and air?
How does it go without sparks and explosions?
How does it go without gears or transmissions?
How does it go, you ask yourself?
Just because a lot of people want it to work, it's no guarantee.
Classic falling-for-your- caseworker, you know.
Let's drink.
We're gonna have a little drink here, please.
Wouldn't you prefer, for example, to lend a hand?
In this delivery of souls, people unveil their lives... some fight, others smile... some let go, as if I'm wrapping them up... and they're at peace.
- Probably busy boning Marlin anyway. - Somebody help me!
If he finds out, he'll go mental.
Can you help me out?
That little karate testing thing, I'm gonna do it.
I'm patching things up with my wife, and it really is probably not gonna work if a former flame of mine is taking class here.
There's something not right here, Alex.
Can you use an extra man?
The only way that's gonna happen is if we work together.
It's not perfect, but it'll work.
You should be careful, too.
You have to be careful. You can't hurt yourself.
Maybe not now, but what if it breaks down later?
You don't have any money. That won't work.
-I need help to carry something.
I sell my ass to get by, once in a while.
You'd be surprised. It works.
The flower helped a bit but not that much.
You handle him well.
Gee, I was sure that would work.
I wanted to ask you if we could go for a drink.
You'd better hope it works.
Mr President, I thought it was important to let you know what's happening.
You'd better hope it works.
He's working with us on a provisional basis.
OK, I will.
You know, there's something wrong with people like you.
I think it works.
Jack, this better work.
- And it does!
And I want to make this work.
That's like being sick of breathing!
Well, I'm glad things worked out for you and this little girl.
You just have to really try to think about something serious. That always helps,
Okay. 8,593 for Roslin, which puts her over the top.
All the officers giving you a hard time.
When do we turn the corner?
Bill, my husband, he helps her out whenever she needs anything.
And sleep in.
- Oh, please, just sleep in.
See if you can help her out with everything after you get off work.
I know it seems loony but I'm telling you, it works.
That's the way it is.
If I get this right I'll be able to tell you the age, sex and race of Warren Granger's killer.
- There's something wrong with that girl.
Guy acts like he's the only one dying around here.
How the hell you guys make ends meet?
I understand that... it's a little hair-Raising, But this--This is the process. Ok?
And it works, Deena.
If I move up, I want Gerald to assume chairmanship of the corporation's committee.
I'm gonna be direct with you, and I'd appreciate it if you'd be honest in return.
It was love at first sight.
I hope we find something.
How does it work ?
Now, we get a jump on this, and we won't have to rely on the last resort.
Wait a minute, how do you know that works?
Okay, concentrate, because it has to.
Remember, get the sisters to use the power of three as soon as possible so we can see if it's going to work or not.
They, who could decimate our entire clan on a whim.
How do you know they are not deciding our punishment as we speak?
And we know how abductions go.
Oh man. Give me a hand.
Unsub could have been hunting during practice.
- So how's that working out?
Hey, Walt, something is wrong here.
Hey, J.J., let's grab some water, huh, chief?
Hey, what do you think about helping a brother out?
Why don't we just cut the word games, and tell me what you want.
Give me a hand here, son.
Walt, give me a hand.
That's the little Nigger General all over.
Oh that the countess and Claudia should be wheeling across the thoroughfare even as we speak.
I know you like to knock a few back before bedtime. Go on, take it.
Well, i saw that tom was overwhelmed, so i thought i'd give him a hand.
And you shouldn't have done what you did, but we just wanna help you move on.
Oh, this is so alpha tau.
Wait, Susan, are you saying you don't want me to be your surgeon?
And they seem very nice. But there's-- there's something about themthat'S... off.
Let's see if you've still got it.
We could find a way to make it work.
-Thought I'd come in and lend a hand.
-Trust me, they work.
And I have tried to make it work, but I just...
Just... it might not work, because I've had training.
They call it a crush, because chances are if you open your mouth, you're gonna get crushed.
but "crush" is just quicker.
After that, she became my Bus Crush.
I call it a Bus Crush because this one happened on a bus.
One time I had an Elevator Crush.
There was my Window Crush.
There was only one problem with my Bus Crush-- she had a boyfriend.
As bad as my Valentine's Day had been going, I knew I could count on my bus crush to make it all right.
If you have a crush, you get crushed.
And I've been trying to get a job, but it's not working out so far.
I've been real busy and i don't have much stuff,so... you need a hand?

Bye.
I don't know, but I do know it doesn't work on women.
- How's it goir?

Well, I was warned to tone it down, but I figured, you know, it's tradition, right?
I know how these things work.
Thanks for the heads up.
Let me give you a hand there, Adam. Attaboy.
Very fifth grade of you, but very effective.

You know what, our job is to scare, and by the look on your face, I'd say we did a pretty good job.
I needed a visitor to make my escape work.
Something isn't sitting right with me.
How does this work?
All right, give me a hand.
It actually does work, and at some point we detach, and the ship's million-year-old structural integrity gives, and we end up vaporized. That's the worst that can happen.
Let's see if this works.
I really do, but we've been back and forth so much, how do we make this work?
We want this to work, not just for us but... for our family.
How'd you know that was gonna work? I didn't.
We could be talking about time travel.
I can give you a hand if you like.
Guys, uh, could you please hurry, 'cause I already shaved once today?
You think you're gonna find closure in the justice system, and you won't.
Not much of a conversation and this kid has perfected the art of playing deaf.
- Hey, uh, we're gonna meet Peter for drinks A little bit later.
Some very bad guys go back on the street, And the next time they try to blow something up, it works.
I don't know a lot about relationships or how they work or what they look like when they do, but I am an expert on what they look like when they don't.
Don't worry. - I do want us to get on.
It worked.
I'm having a culinary crisis. Does that count?
You do that, I'll take Sarah for a pint.
That was Ian. - That was Ian all over.
And you really believe we can keep this up for any serious length of time?
I don't like to play games, so I'm just gonna lay my cards on the table.
If this is going to work, we're gonna have to take things slow.
I should have fought a lot harder to make things work.
My friend Cynthia... she bought some a few months ago, and she said it really spiced things up.
Well, if it doesn't, just try flirting with a really cute guy... in front of your husband.
What do you think you're you doing here?
But if we want this bust to stick, we need more than just a conversation.
At least it works.
Yeah, how does that work?
What kind of guy are you? Paying all that money just to witter on?
so I hope we can make it work this time.
Maybe I want to stay right here this summer and try to make things work out with Ben.
I don't really think it will work out and-- oh, and you had sex with Grace, and Tom hates you.
You don't want some help?
Nah, I don't guess that would work.
I have tried to make this work.
I missed her, but I needed to move on.
Work!
Don't worry. We'll stay after work today and I'll show you all about it.
Do you know how to use it?
You really don't understand how this works.
I'm dark fae, So if we're gonna be cool, keep the light out of my business.
I've sent for help.
Michael, say this works.
But it's working for him.
- Why isn't this working?
And Kevin Blake has just moved into first.
Pilar, just tell me how this stuff works.
Guys, a little help.
Hopefully that'll get us out of here quickly.
Might have found the bottom of the bottle...
The only chance we have of making this work is if there are no secrets between us.
We wanna know how it all works.
I don't know how it works. But I was handpicked by the previous director to take charge.
Just how does it all work?
And I don't know how it works, but every member reaps the rewards.
That's why we work so well together.
There's something wrong with you.
So you gonna join us for beers at O'Reilly's?
- Neil, give me a hand.
Can you give me a hand, Neil?
Yeah, sounds like Joan.
Very Andy circa '87.
How's it work?
Of course. Now that I'm officially off the clock, I was wondering If you wanted to join me for a little drink?
Oh, what if it does work out, and she has babies?
I'm working the event anyway, so we'll all be there,
Just tell him to watch the ears.
All right, you're on. 100 quid.
Could you do me a favour?
All I can tell you is, stick in it as long as you can, fight the good fight, and at the end of the day, if it's bad, that inner ref inside you?
Oh, don't even think about canceling on me, woman.
Can you please just get to the point?
- Could you give us a hand, Dad?
If it works, how long d'you think it'll be before they find us?
I'm really hungry.
Hey, listen. Trust me, it is.
You're one of the beautiful people too, which is why it works.
Okay, you got it.
How do we know it works?
Yeah, but you're working it out.
And I almost fell for it.
You'll get used to her.
That's not how it works with us.
It's time to move on.
We're not getting a drink.
You'd give me a severe talking to, and then you'd throw your arm around my neck and say, "let's get a drink, kid."
The scare tactics are working!
If they landed nearby, they might be going back to base.
I don't care if you cheat, just make it work for you.
I just wanna know how it works.
How does it work?
We can kind of butt heads a little bit.
- This don't look right.
And then Anders and I took Jenna out to dinner, And then we met up for drinks afterwards, And before knew it all these little, old feelings
Wanna come get a drink with us, big guy?
It's Morgan, who are we kidding?
Especially when it's a close relative asking?
See? I knew that would work.
I don't want her there, but if it doesn't work out, she's gone.
Yes, mind-blowing make-up sex... It can fix any marital issue.
So, let me ask you, how does this work?
Never mind. Well, it usually works with firearms.
Hey, you need a hand with any of this stuff?
You think it works?
Falling head over heels is a good indicator.
And it works because we trust each other.
Better watch what I say around him.
Here we are having a wholesome Sunday morning, and Victoria's probably skulking through some hotel lobby with her knickers stuffed in her purse and her blouse inside out.
I want this to work.
I mean, the pothead had jungle fever, and you could have gotten the other one with a taffy apple.
Maybe we should take a lesson from them.
And if it doesn't work, we can park you at the end of a runway.
Whose it not going well with? Teachers?
- That's not how it works.
- No, It doesn't work like that.

Frankie,give me a hand over here,all right?
I can help you with the next one--

- There's more to it than that, but it really makes a difference.
Well, here's how it works with celebrities.
The experiment has to be successful!
That's Anna for you.
And she would be smiling on down on us right now and she'd be saying, "Make it work".
So, Want to go have a few drinks to celebrate?
I'm only going to tell you because I never want to hear you ask again.
Let's get a drink so you can get your color back.
Besides, my fucking brother never helped me one bit.
La Muñeca and this guy they call "El Mariete" will lend us a hand.
- Then so be it.
That's fine. It's a done deal.
In theory, yes, but that's not the way the world works.
I mean just so happy it's working.
That is vintage Renee.

# You caught my eye then you stole all the rest of me... #
Ah, well, "Sometimes in soccer, you have to score goals."
But it was something I had to do to let go.
Maybe it's time we both moved on.
Um, apparently, it works.
I knew that there was something wrong with the tea.
You think that's gonna bring me closure?
The infection vectors from this morning's were classic Petrovna.
- I don't think that's an actual thing.
When you mate for life, and your life is centuries you make it work.
Mama Kmetko's gonna make sure it does this time, OK?
Doesn't work, I wash my hands and you can go on and do whatever you want.
So I don't know how it works.
When it works, it works.
Actually, I do. That's how that room works.
What if it doesn't work? What if I stay this way forever?
Oh, classic Sandra.
Anyway, I was thinking that maybe I can give you a hand.
I think it works.
Someone has to stay on top of things while you are off joyriding.
Well, so she doesn't get a hangover.
So it better be, for Ruth's sake.
Yeah, great. Fine. OK.
And next time you see me, I'll hit you back with some change, Captain.
Dad, why don't you give me a hand here, please?
Hey, a little help here.
A bucket of cold water. It works on dogs.
Well, I- - It works out pretty well, because--
Oh? You look refreshed for having drunk so much last night.
- As a victim, I can vouch it works.

He was helping me.
- You'd be helping out.
This thing works well

Now, do it.

One lightning strike, eight victims.
That lightning bolt was like a one-in-a-million shot, so I gotta take one, too.
Yeah, he said, um, you know, you could, you know, give me a hand, you know, with my little problem.
Bit of a crush on me, of course. Yeah.
Oh, shit, is working.
Come on, let's drink.
I didn't leave on a whim, I thought it over.
- Okay, well, then, help us out.
- I'm gonna go give 'em a hand.
Hey, Simon, I'm just gonna get straight to the point.
Honey, fire always does the trick.
Right. - Don't even think about canceling.
- Pretty much exactly you. - Yeah?
- I'll give you points for improvising, but you know the odds that this will work are slim to none.
I really hope this works.
Just give it a whirl. I just wanna see how it works.
I believe in love at first sight.
So do I, but we didn't love each other at first either.
You know how the world works.
I don't know how that world works.
Every belt needs to be tightened.
You're solo from here. But when we're done, we'll meet at the Fox and Crown, have a beer and watch it on the news.
Look, I know how much you wanted things to work out with Sam.
I'm gonna have a drink with Sam tonight and just show up tomorrow.
There's something wrong inside of Ryan, part of him that's not working right.
The squeezy... squeezy thing's not working for me.
I don't want to be someone who can't move forward.
We should be out there looking for her!
- Of course it's not doing it!
That was Danny.
...thanks for helping me out. How did you know this would work?
If you're serious about this, we have to discuss how it's going to work.
Okay, well how does it work?
Forget that-- don't let Coach in your kitchen. All right?
None of them wants to have a drink with me.
- Anna, how does it work?
This plan had better work.
Give me a hand with this sow!
Come on, chris, just help us out.
That's what happens.
Guess it worked.

It's neck and neck. Musketeer's Cat Springs for the finish.
I'm having wonderful success with it.

I wanna cut right to the chase.
On the long road to grief recovery don't be surprised if you gotta spill a little blood to get shit fixed.
Feelin' it?

I want to knock that out before we get too many worshipers, got it?
If you ever want to have closure...
Okay? Closure doesn't exist.
Anyway... Back to business.
And if you didn't?
Then... you didn't.
How would a book like that work, exactly?

I don't know where the- you don't know how to work- no, it's just gonna- phone?
But I love him and I want to make it work, you know?
But it does work.
Wait. "kid" is also a word for goat. Does she mean baby goats or children?

Vlaartark may be a chicken-ass pussbag, but I bring the heat!

I'm saying we should be cautious, and spill blood only when we're sure it should be spilled.

Trading blows with me while half the city is about to be blown to kingdom come?
I was barely putting food on the table as it was.
If this were a romantic comedy, we'd be in the middle of our "meet cute."
Helping my pregnant wife with the domestic chores?
It's kind of a girl's name.
Well I would if I could collect, but it's pretty clear how things are! ALL: Ugh.
It really works, too.
Well, those are things you can accomplish with a datebook and a clock, though.
Yeah, we all go for drinks at this place after work.
- Let's see if it works.
- Eh, some of us can move on.
You'd like to run the hellcats.
Here's how it works:
While we're talking about it, she could be dying.
I don't know how things work in your family.
I need to stop trying so hard and relax.
I've still got my mobile phone.
Go have a drink.
Well, say it with cantaloupes and plums if you have to.
Yeah, it's all real solid. And if this works out,
I guess if this works out, we'll have to shift our time table.
- That sounds like dad. - It does.
I have to admit, I did not think it was gonna work, but it's totally working.
I feel exactly like a seahorse.
Like throwing pearls to the pigs, eh?
You nearly gave me a heart attack.
Oh my God, this is totally working.
Here's how it works.
I tried to make it work.
All right, so how does this work?
- This is wrong.
(sets down photo) is that how it is?
I'm going to try to get you all out, if this works.

Well, that did it.
So you don't believe in love at first sight?
You may need to take charge, become... Become king.

I'm getting a bit pissed off with these looks I'm getting.
You must be exhausted.
The problem with Meachem is Sean Payton is evil for fantasy football.
You have got to be kidding.
Oh, he can't hear anything over middle c, so I guess it works.
You should be setting your lineup. Pete, my lineup is fine.
Later, let's have a glass of soju.
I don't have to get badmouthed by superior officers, I don't have to run until my legs break, I don't have to worry about credit card expenses, and I don't need to be stressed.
Just don't go in there... at all. Ok, roll sound. Are you recording?
For example helping out at a farming village.
Really?
You know what? It's really busy, believe it or not!
I need you to find someone
Continue to report the situation to me.
That's the deal.
You said I was supposed to come visit you and tell you how it's going? Yes, yes, please.

What are you doing?
Oppa, is this called love at first sight?
However I think it, something is not right.
But if I do make it, you'll have to audition for me.
Could it be that something's wrong with that manager?
They must be examining what is truly behind your proposal.
This doesn't normally happen.
You should be making preparations for Iron Fist.
Someone need a hand?

If anyone should down there helping, it oughta be you.
It's gotta work!

I don't know how it works, but Christmas morning I was sleeping in this little pub keeping away from some Snatchers and I heard it.
Who is corrupt? Who can be trusted? Above all, who controls the reins of business?
So if you wouldn't mind getting to the point.
What do you think you're doing here, Miller?
You just better watch it.
I was just helping 'em out, you know?
I'll tell ya how crack works.
Say you get through the checkpoints and roadblocks. If you showed up in my bedroom in the dead of night asking me to help out Uncle Sam, I'm going to react unpredictably.
And now you want me to help you kill all these men?
- I'm checking if it's working.
That was butt-cold.
No, I'm really in pain because I really love you, and I'm scrambling to make this work.
And if that doesn't work, we can check herfor parasites tomorrow if you want.
Go get your water.
Once upon a time, in a land called Buffalo, there lived a little girl named Jules Daly, who dreamt of traveling to far-away places, where people sang for a lark and danced on a whim.
But if this doesn't work, I don't know what else will.
That's just like him.
Every time, it works!
The stun gun, it works!
And then I thought, "There's George." Grace and humour. And a weird kind of angry bitterness about certain things in life.
I'll, I'm practising this so that when I die I will know how to leave my body and I'll be familiar and I won't be frightened.
Now I want closure, you know?
Okay, so how does it work? They just, um, call you on your cell,
See, the way it works is... you have to be chosen.
Yeah, I really don't think that's gonna work.
If it doesn't work out, I can always leave.
Something's wrong here.
Alright, let's make it a grand. -Deal?
Pappy, the Sheriff is standing right here, helping us out.
That would be this working.
Oh, I want this one.
Well, the city may be going to hell but we are going dancing.
You better watch your back there, Will.

Yo, maharajah, wanna get my back for me?
He happens to be visiting Yemen and needs my help withdrawing 9.5 million dollars from a local bank.
I'm not sure if it's working, Wizard.
By the way, it's a different way.
If later is okay, why not now?
All right.
All right.
All right.
And then it just works by pressing the button.
Okay. All right. But I have to call Aiden.
All right.
All right.
All right. Here we go.
All right.
Have the seven "Stab" movies, all based on Gale Weathers' books about you, made it even harder to go on?

-Sounds good. Deal.
But before you go, do you want to help me with a little something?
He's probably putting her to bed or something.
Do you think it would work on me?
Baby, that is not the way it works around here.
Here, let me help.
Are we gonna have a problem, me and you?
So instead of accusing her, you might wanna ask her for some pointers.
- Alrighty
In this trade, when people covet your death more than your life... it's understood that it's time to move on.
How does it work?
But you're gonna have to help me out, see?
Come, give a hand!
Are you sure this is gonna work?
- You think that would work?
But if it's going to work, it's going to need your full support.
Fixed it, love. Working like a charm.
Insanity may play at the office, but it's not gonna work in front of a judge.
I'm really ashamed about this, and I just want to put it behind me as soon as possible.
Do you need some help?
Come on, you're not supposed to be the one crying, Bella.
I just thought you should know.
Hobson, how does this bag of tea work?

And you're gonna help me.
No help.

And it's gonna take everything to make it work.
It's time to move on.
You know what? I want to do several shots of tequila black out, and forget I ever saw the rat face and mouse pee-pee.
- How does this work?
Come have a drink with me and the guys.
Yeah, let's do it. The north face.
- It costs an arm and leg.
- It costs an arm and leg.
What makes you think Flint'll show?
And a free pair of hands.

Don't you think we should be doing something, Fred?
Doesn't matter if it works or not, dolly.
You can stay on my couch, help with the restaurant.
She wanted a drink but she wouldn't have one.
(SPANISH) Do you need a hand with that?
Are we doing this?
Honey, er, let him catch his breath, take a drink.
Oh, it will, Piglet.
But if I do not deliver, they will kill someone.
I said, watch my fucking suit, man, all right?
Times are tough and we're all having to clamp down.
Hey, you need a hand with that?
Figure out how this deal works.
How is that working out for you?
If you're trying to turn me on, it's working.
I mean, you should be a mess by now, but things are not...
I'm gonna have to be careful.
It works. That's amazing.
He was wondering if there's anything he should bring, to our party.
I hired him immediately.
Need some help?
And what with the U2 connection... Yeah, this story should make a great splash.
I can't. We're supposed to be sound checking right now.
Pretend you're taking a shit or something.
- All of a sudden. - What the fuck, Sam?
Supposed to be over the hill.
That's the dynamic of this situation.
- Try to watch. - Ill-bred pups.
Let us have a drink. Celebrate.
See at the wedding. - Imran, can you help me?
The flag still rises.
I came to tell you that we have an appointment tomorrow at 2:00, so if that works for you...
Yep. And how's that going for you?
You'll not get that one in a harness, let alone pulling a plow, even drunk on a Tuesday night. You know that.
You don't even know how it works.
Do your job without complicating things.
I was trying to move on.
I agree. But it works every time.
You know how this works, right?
You're going to have to make the plays now, Nick.
Do you want to know how it works?
They're gonna try and make as many people hate your guts as possible before we go to trial.

Fucking cold as hell.
So, you boys busy or... Maybe you can give me a hand with the rubble.
You must be wiped out, man.
Something feels wrong.
No, you bring it with the...
You must get sick of having to think for everybody.
- All right, fuck off, all right?
I mean she... she's probably sick of my horseshit anyway, you know?
I don't think it works that way.
Have a seat, Iet me buy you a drink.
-Relax.
How otherwise? Buy them dinner and drinks at the VIP lounge at the Pacha...
-Scared of what? -Of things working out between us.
Maybe you're the one scared of things working out. You've done nothing but screw things up since you got here.
That's just the way it goes.
You remember how to use it you just plug the microphone into the...
How do you work this thing?
You really gotta be careful about what's going on up here.
How does it all work?
How does what work?
Let's see if it works?
Yes, it works.
You know, you should be doing this with me.
Let me just see how it works on my board.
Gotcha.
If I'm here tomorrow, you'll know it works.
Tell Miss Morgan it's working.
You can't watch your back.
It looks like love on paper, but it never really works out.
How does that work?
"P." It's for the paralysing crush I had on the new girl in my math class in the eighth grade.
I didn't mean to mess up your plans. It all happened so fast.
How's that paper coming in Simon's class?
But how did you know it would work?
You're helping the old man out, and this kid is like a bonus for doing the right thing.
Yeah, I'm not just helping the old man out.
I told you it wouldn't work out, but you wouldn't listen.
Look at my arms.
Listen, my wife and I want to do what we can for the needy.
Why did you take risks?
Yeah, he's probably crying in some fucking beer somewhere.
Well, if you're doing it to pick up chicks, you're doing a lousy job
Yep, they're on.

- It finally works.
We're not working out.
You told me to call If I see anything odd.
They must be really popular.
See? It's working already.

The evidence is that there's something wrong here.
I know how counterfeiting works.
Okay, how does this work?
I wonder if it'll work on Dr. Saroyan.
If her victim was of average size and he survived the attack... he could be dying of blood loss right now.
That's not how it works.
How did you know that would work? I didn't.
I'd finished a background check. I was just giving her the download.
Which means it's tried and true.
I find, in my business, it's important to... Keep up with current events.
It's just how it's played.
Well, that definitely would've given him the cash needed to make ends meet.
And then, they can't move on and their lives are ruined forever.
Sorry, Tom, none of your business over here.
Um... my divorce is starting to really sink in.
He's a shoo-in for prom king, and after winning the big game, he'll help me land crucial swing votes.
How many times do you have to make the same mistake to realize it's not going to work out?
Well, how much are you gonna drink?
Why isn't it working?
How does this thing work?
Shouldn't we hold back a few grenades in case it doesn't work?
If this doesn't work, well, then it doesn't matter what we do.
Whether it works or not, you find your way to the personnel elevator in 15 minutes and you join us, okay?

No duh! Being ourselves doesn't work.
Just, uh, watch and learn, all right?
I thought you might like to sleep in.
Wait, you think that now is the time to be throwing back shots?
What do you mean it's working? I heard the keys tapping away.
Well, that's Jack for you. I told you he couldn't be trusted. Really?
But I like to think that it applies to life.
And I just need to make sure that I've done everything I can to make it work.
And I try to keep up on current events.
Damn, I thought that would work.
So how does this work?
It does feel like it's working.
How does this work?
Elijah thought that would work and he was an Original, so.

Wow, that was like you were just channeling Nora.
I'm... I'm glad it worked out for you guys.
We can not walk without taking the head?
- This is not a thunderbolt.
I did not think it would work with you.
I know it hurts, but I'm making progress, honey.
But I don't see it as necessarily working.
Here, I'll give you a hand. I got it.
We agreed we're moving on.
Nicki, this is a way we can all move forward together as a family, spiritually reaffirmed.
We may have to tighten our belt a little while longer.
Yeah, but that independent streak... no, I don't think it'd work.
I knew from the first day we went out that I'd spend the rest of my life with you.
Everybody living on top of each other? You know it isn't working as well as I do.
Listen, my lawyers are burning through my money and we're gonna have to tighten our belts.
Don't you believe in love at first sight?
We don't want kids for a long time. It's good to be young without kids. We kill kids.
That's not your bone, silly. Who's a silly boy?
Oh, my God, it's working!
Unfortunately, it also works the other way around.
Yeah, I did. Well, then, why aren't they working?
When you're investigating events from your own life, it's harder to turn the page.

See, you've got to be careful with these waiters.
- A lot of guys think that's a good move. It's funny.
You've just got to forget about it.
Can you show me how to work this?
And there are people who work here who need this company to succeed whether you do or not.
I care about you a whole lot, but if things are gonna work out between us, you gotta make things right with your folks.
What is over.

- I don't know.
If it works, great.
-A little help here.
So, how's that whole band thing workin' out?
Thing is going game busters.

What if this doesn't work, man?
Because it's totally working.
Deal.
How does that work exactly?
You know, give you a hand.
Wanna go and get a drink?
Show him that he can't use you.
Let's get you guys some drinks.
Like right now, you would be out hunting somewhere trying to get a natchiq for me.
You want to watch yourself with this one.
You must have been camping, the three of you.

Alice is probably sitting at home right now thinking of how she's going to fire us.

Because it's working.
Lend me a hand, huh?

How does a family just get over something like that?
I hope to hell that works.
I mean, you didn't honestly think that worked?
I told you we'd get it.
Ted, it doesn't work like that.
That he was, in fact, at Boyd Park trying to talk an alcoholic into taking a drink?
Ken Corrigan decided he'd rather have a drink.
Nolan was being groomed to take over the family business.
He doesn't like that even when it's working.
That's why it's working.
And then he spent his whole career "casting pearls before swine", He talked like that...
We can only hope that it works again.
We don't know that for sure. All we know is it ain't workin'!
Hell, yeah. Fever on him like that means it's workin'.
Yeah, actually, I asked. It doesn't work like that, but it must be a relief.
That was never going to work.
Oh, I'm telling you, Mildred, if that guy's here, you are in!

Something's wrong.
Something's fishy.

Hey, if it works, I'll quote anyone.
Oh, do you need a hand, Bryce?
And yet, somehow it works.
That's the only way this works.
She's been helping out here every day as a favor.
See how this could work out for everybody?
Would you mind helping?
It'll heal if it works.
I know that as much as being broken up hurts, being alone is way worse.
I'm sure your agent skills will come in handy.
How does this work?
I have to admit. If you hadn't come along, I might not have.
You know how this goes.
Whatever hell scam you're pulling is working.
I'm not sure that would work.
So I thought I'd look in and give you a hand, brushing, mending, cleaning shoes - whatever's needed.
Perhaps it was a spur of the moment decision.
I would like to think of this award as some sort of closure, it's...
You wanna do the bridge?
Hey, looks like you could use a hand there.
And I need this to work.
I'm sorry, I thought that would work! Really.
- You need help with that?
I told you that Whit is an old friend and he was here helping me out.
Amber worked odd jobs to make ends meet.
This year she can go... Blow a balloon.
Best-case scenario -- it does.
That's not how it works.
Hey, you know, a little help would be nice.
I know how it works--
And our business took off.
And if it works, and we're successful, God bless.
Let's just hope it works, huh?
Won't beat around the bush.
- That works. - Wet willy works. - Old style now?

Well, if your fiancé would kindly give me a hand.

How did that work out for you?
Do you know how this works?
Need a hand?

Pop goes the weasel.
Pop goes the weasel what'll you give me for it?
That's Lance, nice to everyone.
Can we just jump right in?
If this works out, I'll treat you to Peter Luger's.
All I know is it works on fools and imbeciles.
Damn it, that is classic him.
I don't think this one's going to work.
Like how I want to try living together for six months and if it works, we sell one of our houses? His house.
- I just got inspired and went with it.
Or somebody might have an irrational fear of going over the Shady Lake Bridge.
- Good. It's going good.
He was asked to sacrifice his son. You just have to pitch in and help kill a whore. I don't think I can do that.
I don't know how this works, but if there's something I need to do in return, I'll do it.
How's it working out for you?
He could be weeing or anything.
I'll get right to the point.
That's what I should be doing.
Leslie. Oz, it's working.
On the off chance that doesn't work, I've run a hacking program for the last three hours. It's gonna bust right through Oz's system.
That's very thorough of you to dot your I's and cross your t's. See?
Right now this ain't working.
But right now this ain't working.
I'm more of, like, in the bedroom kind of type of dancer.
Just give me the spray can, and tell me how it works.
I have no idea.
Look, I'm sorry. I really thought this would work.
Is there something wrong with your neck?
Look, you guys, T.K. is gonna get bored of this woman in five minutes if you don't make a meal out of it.
Boy, you really are the spitting image of your father.
Does that trick with books work?
My beliefs, my way of doing things, that's just fine.
No, I'm pretty sure that's not how it works. All right?
I'd like you to be there, see how it works, okay?
If the batty acts up, I'll lend a hand.
No, no. This is the opposite...
Does that work?
Well, yeah, that would be Jason.
He sees this girl serving coffee and then it hits him, love at first sight.
That's how it works.
I'll get straight to the point.
And if giant rabbit can lay chocolate eggs, maybe you and Edna can find a way to make it work.
Typical ruddy Jack.
Hey man, being hot is like a full time job.
What the fuck... do you think you're doing?
I said we'd go or a drink.
Cos that always works.
- Billy, as long as it works.
Then it will work.
- Let's get a drink.
"Shit. We can't have this.
I'd like to hear about that.
Brother, I don't have to do anything, but if you want her gone, this is the way.
I don't think this is working.
Why don't I give you a hand?
OK agreed. Three.
Are you sure you don't need a hand?
It took you all of, what, a day to figure out how that happens in this place?
This is how things work.
Well, at least we know the gut juice works.
Work, damn it work!
Wanna give me a hand, princess?
I'm just saying this displaced-New Yorker thing you got going is gonna kill out here.
There's something suspicious about her.
All right, I'll just come straight out and say it.
It's crazy but it works!
Let's get a drink, man, come upstairs.
The Security Committee meeting went well.
Her presentation fell apart when it came to how to finance the package.
- Yes. Laura!
And it's working.
- Sure. - Good.
Let my her know I'm okay.
And how's that working out for you?
I don't know about Langley, but these work fine for Mossad.
Tell your boys to be careful with the Claymores.
Definitely Stefan.
And I do whatever he says. That's the way it goes around here.
So, if what you're offering me now, in this, my most desperate moment, is rejection, I might just freak out here in your office with your nice new windows, furniture... Nancy.

If I tell my parents, they are gonna flip out.
We'll make it work.
It's not a primitive gut instinct like in a card game. It works.

And I just wanted the dude off our property, so, you know, sorry about the illegal burial, but it was, like, very spur-of-the-moment.
I'm just trying to lend a girl a helping hand, Evi.
Just a regular guy here, okay, trying to make a dollar, that's it.

But only because I'm trying to make ends meet and they pay really good money on the black market for that.
Wait. Wait. Hear me out.
It's not necessarily the way Kacy and I are a couple, but, you know, as long as it works for them...
I think that it's sort of classic Rachel behavior to bottle everything up and try to self-medicate to, like, make it go away.

You know, there's a system in this country and it works.
They're either plotting to take TYPX away from me or club baby seals -- haven't really figured that one out.
Uh! That was an incredible Stallone.
I thought it would work too.
God, I hope this works.
- Hey, need a hand?
Charlie, help me out?
Now would be a great time to stop whatever it is you're doing or looking at and open those Tiffany boxes!
I wanted to move on to give you the happy life you deserve.
But I had to find a new way to move on with my life.
We look around, ask questions, you remember how that works.
Yeah, that sounds like Molly, apologetic and contrite.
We can just make sure we get our stories right when we express gratitude anyway, so it's not hard.
I told you that was gonna work out.
Like I'm gonna fall for that!
Is that the way it works?
It's all pretty straightforward and I'll pay ya.
Hey, you gotta fake it till you make it.
I knew this thing was going to be huge because you told me it was going to be.

Is this how you give a hand job?
If you never saw the transcendent in all of this, if the church was just some form of self-imposed stricture to keep you sober, how did you expect it to work?
Look, you're focusing on just that.
- For a minute. I'm waiting for someone.
Hello.
I hope you do it, and I hope it works out for you, but I can't do it with you.
There's no reason to get worked up here.
Shouldn't you be seating people?
Ted, you know how this works.
Yeah, but I'm a doppelganger. It's not gonna work on me.
Why doesn't it feel better?
The second he knows you're alive, he'll figure out why it's not working.
Well, if the most diabolical woman I know can't seem to figure it out, then I must be doing something right.
I have to put it behind me.
And I have no idea how long it's going to last, so let's get right to the point.
Better be careful, brother.
"If we're in the red in a year, we'll piss off abroad!"

I don't know how to work this thing.
Will it work?
- Sure.
That's usually how it works, yeah.
I'm telling you. A raw egg mixed with a little clamato and some crushed-up Oreos works like a charm.
And if that doesn't work?
You help and it goes well, you get your ticket punched.
Thank you for putting up with this. And if it doesn't work, we're gonna fucking do it again.

The only thing that you have to really look out for was the police, you know, 'cause the police can just get ya, frame ya.
I had no doubt that it would succeed.
I need some help squaring the place away, anyway.
You don't even know if this thing works!
We should be getting whacked off, all of us, as a fucking team!
Come on, bro, help a brother out.
Okay, then you know the routine.
That sicko's probably out there right now, staring at us from a distance.
OK, but how does it work?
- That's the way this works! - I don't think so!
- Like I'm gonna fall for that one. - No, seriously. Mate!
You need a drink, my friend?
- See, it doesn't work that way.
Me and your dad are good.
Where does this fuckin' key go?
I told you it'd work.
That works too.
And stop saying all these lies about Munga.
Here, I'll show you how it works. Just--
I really wanna make it work with her.
Now he's gonna try to "make it work." Plane crash.
I need to figure out a way to make it work with Veronica.
You're probably giving your card to some girl in yoga right now but if that doesn't work out for you I think I'm ready to beat you in Scrabble.
How will I know if it works?
And Klausener?
- So we wait until after it's fired?
Makes electricity look like a pile of crap.
So, how does it work in the house?
Work it, god.
You get happy and be nice.
The greater the energy, the greater the chance of manifestation.
Oh, shit, it's working. It's working.
All right, give mea hand.
Must be a pain not being able to eat what you want.
Well, with a little heads-up, I could've helped with the clothes at least.
Did it work?
I went on impulse.
But that's not how it works.
And check it, this is how it goes
Salud. Oh, yeah? Is that how it works?
And it's all because he wanted to help me out.
I'm curious, you know, how's this thing work?
You're starting to screw with my head.
But in your opinion, it works well enough.
No. I can't just pick up and go to Connecticut. I can't, not with a 9-year-old.
We better be careful.
Are you sure you're not freaking out?
Well, I hope it works out either way.
But, if it doesn't, I'm gonna take this piece of paper, and I'm gonna make it into a nice paper airplane.
Let me tell you how the world really works.
If this works I'll wear a tutu and pink pantyhose.
And what if this doesn't work?
Yeah, but apparently, it works better if you're pretty.
I'm sick of them lying to me and I know that it's never going to work.
I know, right. He's helping me with this whole bounty hunting thing so I can nail Morelli.
R. Kelly always does the trick.
Oh! That's something to keep in your back pocket, because that's a no-fail.
and cradle those balls.
This could all be pre-recorded and I could be talking to you from the bottom of the ocean.
Norman, I know you and Grandma were very close, but we all have to move on.
You know, by rights, I'm supposed to be frolicking in paradise with your grandfather.
I'm training you to survive Mavericks, not some, uh... silly teen crush.
- Would you like a hand with that?
Do you want to go get a drink after this?
You're in my head, man. You're fucking with me on every turn.
Okay, if I want this thing to pay off... I've got to look at it as an outsider.
Give me your hand.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Well, I guess, then, I'm in.
- I know it didn't work out between us but, please, do try and get over it.
We got to find a way to make this thing work, and we got to stick at it.
- Come on, give us a hand!
How the hell does this thing work?
Dude is running five minutes behind.
How long does this take to work?
Classic Brueder!
Classic Brueder.
I told you it wouldn't work.
Because it's working!
-That's it, we're no angels.
It's not personal, that's how it goes.
Honestly, Andy, I fell in love with him kind of instantly.
Anita says that it would be good for you to get some closure with that relationship.
Maybe it'll help you get on with your life.
- All right, dude.
When they chained me and left me for dead Just for stealing a mouthful of bread!
Want to drink?
Yeah, it does.
I need closure. I don't know.
How does that work, if you don't mind me asking?
Eventually he invites me back to his house for more drinks.
I know the score.
Get a sense of place here.
We'll stay here. End of story. - I'm scared.
One granny. Two tea cups. Something's wrong with the picture, right?
I was just trying to help out.
I got a bet going, okay?
They figure if a kid can do it...
Nothing. You, uh, you want a drink?
Let's go for a drink.
Wanted to see if I could help out.
Lazy-Eye, no, but you know what, we're actually in the middle of something here, in case you didn't notice.
If the cards remain in place, only the spirit of a very friendly stagehand is going to be moving that table.
-I'll give you a hand.
Nobody thought it would take.
Let's have a drink. Let's talk about it.
That's how it's running.
I don't know how that shit works or what's, like, normal or....
All right? You know, if this thing goes all right, this is my last night a priest.
- Up? I'll give you a lift.
Freddy, can we get a hand here?
- Freddy, give me a hand.
- About what? - Honestly, I don't think this is working out too well.
- Do not act on a whim. - I, too, will sign the agreement - so I have the right to opinion.
Bang! Fucking love happens.
Is it working?
Have you found someone to help out?
You see how this works?
Mitzi, I'm gonna cut to the chase.
May I... as you say in America, cut right to the chase, professor?
I don't think you really understand how it works down here.
Don't you know how this works?
If this works, it's gonna be a damn miracle.
Oh, you think that really works, do you?
You can't just keep yelling out the name of the game, Pierre, that's not how it works.
- I'm gonna drop your ass. - You ain't talking shit now.
I think she liked it.
- hope for the best.
We don't even know if this is gonna work, Jo.
A box of marshmallows, coming up!
I really tried to look out for you with that seven grand.
I'm trying to make this work.
Yeah, all right, yeah.
He is Johnny Boy in the flesh.
There's no problem with me in that area, alright? Everything's working fine down there.
It's obviously working.
Helped me turn a corner.
Without Travis, Wes will overthink himself out of ever making an arrest again.
They broke in a good line, but nobody's in a hurry to take the lead.
If it works out, so much the better...
Can I give you a hand, ma'am?
You need to keep me informed
You guys didn't grill her because you wanted it to work.
There is something very wrong.
Tell him I hope he gets wherever he's goin' and it all works out like he wants.
Last night was a thunderbolt.
Let them think that, it works in our favor.
No, no, not working.
Yeah, it's doing well, but there's an establishment infringing, selling it as their own.
See if it works out.
If it does, yeah, you're hired.
Especially now that you think you're winning the case.
No, really, it works.
Coy plays on any number of levels.
I appreciate a hand now and then, but I really didn't need to be saved by... who're you guys?
A.D: Great. That works.
Who wants a shot, baby?
Jamaica Jay: Come on, yo. That don't work!
This isn't working.

Oh, I sure could use a hand.
You could give me a hand.
And he has not had to deal with surpass every month.
We need more than one hand at the cleaners, Marco.
Then tell him it's a two-way street.
Stop moping.
Uh, he wrangled, like, nine sorority girls for us tonight... so I figured he could help out around here tonight.
I mean, really, who wants to buy that crap when it falls apart in a year... when you can get hand-crafted furniture for a bargain?
I just wanted to tell you that if you strike out with the pros, you know you can always call me, right?
You must be sick of this place by now.
I'm fucking gonna explode, Harry.
I say the same thing every time, no matter what, because it always works.
Man, who's this Wonder-Bread-lookin' motherfucker walkin' around?
I'm turning over a new leaf.
I can never work this thing. Hey.
We need you to give us a hand.
Give me a hand!
You boys need to watch yourselves now.
This is Mud, this is exactly what he does.
Shouldn't you be out there getting me a tooth, you slacker?
DR. LEE: So, tell me how this works.
How everything works.
Oh, that's, um, that's not how the process works.
What do you think you're doing?
I mean, that's how it works.
All right?
Hostage, yes, that works.
So how does it work, your relationship?
Did you want some help?
You had a crush on an eight-year-old?
You know, when you and Bates got together I was kinda happy 'cause I thought "It's fucking lunacy,"
But I know how that shit goes, man.
In fact, I think I may be looking at Kinross and Clark's newest partner.
- I'm sure you know how that works.
Well, you know how it goes.
Okay, that works, assuming someone came in and strangled her after he left.
I mean, how does it work?
I'm just not sure it will work without you.
I think to make it work for you today, we need to, uh...
They know there's something wrong with this case.
If anyone in that courtroom thought the framed defence was crazy, they don't think so now, it's working.
Usually I wouldn't hesitate to help, but my wife says I should take care of my back.
I swear, I'm gonna blow a fuse soon.
Why don't we go outside again and get a drink?
Make it work with her.
You know how this works.
Well, you wanna see how it works?
She has two little babies of her own, and she takes in stray neighborhood kids to make ends meet. And she still won't be a queen for a day.
You know the drill.
Let him know?
I thought you were gonna hook a brother up.
I know you think you're helping me with those charges, too, but-- No, no.
I immediately fell in love with this house.
Hey, princess, how'd it go with the internet?
I'll lend a hand.
You gotta watch out for the snakes, though.
OK, yeah, but maybe she and Bates don't make it, and then you've got yourself another shot at the good life.
- Wanna get a drink?
Yeah, with our history, we wanted to make sure that it would actually work this time before we got our friends and family involved.
But no matter how you might plan for perfection, there's always a hitch.
That's how it goes on the Upper East Side.
Just working jobs like this one to make ends meet.
I don't know how it works up there but Nate's been missing for a while so maybe you could help us out and fix it.
My dreams of being a fighter pilot can go up in real and metaphoric smoke at the same time.
Hmm. I know that wears better as the title of a country song than it does a piece of life wisdom, but I think she was right.
Jerry, we all want her to work for all of our sakes but she almost passed out on the air twice.
But it'll work.
I just need a little help.
I must be dreaming.
Good thing grandpa Dan's here to help us out.
I still don't know how to use that thing.
Just helping your mom out. Oh.
Something is wrong here. I promise.
It's the only way you can leave it behind.
In this case why don't you see and do what people do.
You know how this works, faris.
A man is not allowed to come to his favorite place, and just drink and share a laugh?
Hey, how does it work when you pleasure yourself?
Why don't we go out the back, Jack.
You do understand how this works, don't you?
I knew it would work.
You mind helping me out here?
Oh, just keeping abreast of developments.
I kept hoping that it would work, that I would feel for you what you feel for me, but I don't.
You offer something enticing in exchange for something the target doesn't think they'll miss.
Work! Please work.
Yeah, well, who knows if it'll work, but it'll put some government-issued pork in my pocket.
Seems like it works out for everybody.
Yeah? You think it works out for his wife and her husband?
Think I may need some field hands.
Because you always get sick afterwards.
Give me a hand! Quickly!
He knows how things work.
How's that working out for you?
Now you can come in and sweep her off her feet.
She's trying to make this work so she can be there for you, and for Bonnie, so...
We can make this work.
She wants to make this work.
What do you think you're doing?
That's not how it works.
You know, if this does go off and we drop the history teacher in the Atlantic,
I really do want this to work.
No matter what advice anyone gives, the idea of just moving on... Is impossible.
Now, how the hell does this work?
For what that's worth.
You know it works?
The more action he sees, the more chance he gets to spin out.
Okay, honey, you have to stop pouting because now you're depressing me, you're depressing Zelda, you're just creating this, like, pea soup of depression in this room.
So, how does it work?
You seem to know how to do this.
Okay, let's do it.
In the case of the code of conduct, fuck off, it doesn't work?
Maybe that's how it works for other organizations, but it doesn't seem that that's how it works here.
A boat might not work.
OK, can we skip to the point?
I hope it works out.
You know what? Y'all motherfuckers figure this shit out.
What do you say you and me get the hell out of here, we go get a drink someplace?
As a droid myself, I understand how these things work.
Trying to keep up.
Would Trouty Mouth work?
Listen, why don't I just cut right to the chase?
Even if it doesn't work out with NYADA, you'll find...
Well, you know, if this is gonna work, you're gonna have to shave off all of your body hair.
Study if you must, but if it don't stick, move on, focus on something you're good at.
Woman: ♪ then let me get right to the point ♪
Zoidberg. (Laughs) Classic Hermes.
Here, I'll show you how it works.
Hope it still works.
Who knows what shape they could be in?
Give us a hand. (Whimpers and yells)
I've raised her to behave and obey.
- No, it'll work.
Give me a hand to that control panel.
You wouldn't want to give me a hand with that phosphor cryo-module, would you?
Can I give you guys a hand?
You need closure.
How's that working for you?
But the quickest way to put this behind you is to settle this now, or you're looking at years of appeals.
Nuh-uh, that's not how it works.
Dad, could you give me a hand?
Give me a hand here.
He could be nailing her right now in your race car bed.
Yeah, well that's Shane for you.
I'm 62 years old.
Sweetie, you need an assist. Mm? Just...
And I would love to have closure, but I don't know how to get it.
I need this to work, because...
We needed this for our business.
I bet you would, uh, give a drawer to one of her best friends.
I mean, Jess, she's helping out a ton right now,
Well, it's a hard to keep up with the news when you're cramming for your MCATs.
Bouncer asks the guy if he needs a hand.
2, 3, 5, 7, 8...
That's it.
He's got it.
Two against two. My call, I say yes.
Your little manipulation games won't work here.
Hello?
We'll have our own house.
If it worked.
Will you lend us a hand?
Well, then it has to work.
- Thank you. - Do you need help with that?
I just- Is something wrong with it?
- Just somebody I'm helping out.
Before my dad died, we had a waiting list of people wanting to put the horses in training, and now we're just barely scraping by.
Your mom needed an extra hand, and here we are.
I need closure.
This is so like Chloe, leaving you here eating chocolate for dinner.
Pepper, can I have a little help up here?
You are really gonna blow your stack!
And I... I just... I really care about you, and I really want this to work, and I'm...
Yeah, honey. That's what camp is.
I might be rubbing' one in.
I'll-I'll put it on my card, but I-I-I'm just gonna say it's a gift because that's the only way I can do this anymore.
So if there's any tips you need, you all right?
Thank you, sir. Thank you.
See, it worked.
That's classic Nick Miller.
There's a 60/40 shot that's gonna clear.
Maybe, but if it doesn't, and if this plan of yours works, we're still stuck on this sinking atoll.
Come and give us a hand.
They might have dogs or something. We shouldn't just waltz in here.
I'm wearing boots because I was helping out at the right now boot camp.
Tina said she's been helping out lately at the right now boot camp.
That works too.
Yes, that would work.
You know how this works from here on out.
You should be talking to clients ringside or at a three-star restaurant, not coming into your miserable little office.
And you know that even if that was possible, that's not the way.
You want to help us out?
This is the way it works.
And you'd let him know that you're not some secretary from Brooklyn who's dying to help out.
Some kind of partnership, assuming it works out?
But if it doesn't work out, you're gonna have to act like you never asked.
Because it works.
Well, that's not exactly the way it works, but we can certainly approach them.
Well, then, it works out, because we don't.
How's that work?
What do you think you're doing?
Who's up for a nightcap?
Come on, Brett, give me a hand with this, will you?
- We can get by. - What exactly do you do?
Help me out here, man.
'Cause that's pretty much how it's been the past few years, and that's worked okay.
If it works, the whole of France will order it from me.
You two aren't going to sulk forever, are you?
You know the drill.
Yeah, it works.
It works. Yeah, it works.
A little, but I think it works.
When I came back from Mexico I made you a promise... That I would do whatever it takes, to make this thing work.
It's working, though.
I don't think it works like that.
Fine, right, OK.
No offence. None taken.
Yeah, so? Let's get wasted on Brandon Hill, smoke a fatty.
If it works.
She was just trying to move on.
You know, it's okay for you to move on.
I'm sorry, I don't really know how this works.
David did recruit, uh, myself and Dannie to help him on the tracks on this.
So tell me how this works.
- Yeah, well, it's working.
I'm the one that just got dumped.
Because that's the way it works, Walter.
The older one, I tell you what, he thought it was the funniest damn thing that they would take my head, and they would just shove...
You actually thought that would work?
Please let this work.
He was helping a group of migrants a couple of nights ago with new coyotes, people he hadn't used before.
You should be sleeping.
I just want to let you know, it's working.
But it's working.
Once this guy shows up, and Diana's girls aren't there, he's gonna know something isn't right.
That's not how relationships work.
I did it, it works.
You guys are so good at finding things, maybe you could give my partner a hand.
Not sure how that works.
You help her out sometimes?
Got to admit, thought it was a wild-goose chase.
You think it was love at first sight?
Thanks for helping out with the agent stuff.
Okay, all right, I love you.
- That's how it works!
There's something wrong there.
And if we want to make this work, we're gonna have to put some effort in.
Mike, you're supposed to be sleeping.
This thing we got isn't pretty, but it works.
Well, I don't think it's a good idea to spring Carlos out of rehab for "Wining."
You know, I saw Choady sneaking out when we came in.
Listen-- maybe, in exchange for staying here, you can help me out.
So we can make this work.
I don't think it works like that.
This is how it works.
Hey! What the hell you think you're doing? !
- You should be resting.
Give me a hand.
it was like falling in love with a woman at first sight.
We're perfectly thrilled to have some reinforcements!
What do you think you are doing?
You know how the system works, Jack.
I just thought you should know.
Yeah, supposedly it works well with the goth ghosts.
Just making sure it still works.
So tell me how this works.
We'll ask the questions Santoro doesn't want to, and if it doesn't work out, we'll go do the disgruntled cop interviews, she'll be none the wiser.
Said and said...
Let's do like this, we'll try for a week. Then we'll see if you feel comfortable with me and if I think that you belong at the company.
How the hell's that gonna work?
I swear to you, I've tried to make it work.
I refuse to be hung-over tomorrow.
It'd be just like Frankie to blow our chances of a decent flatmate for a quick shag.
Meanwhile, you're the oldest, so I expect you to help out.
And if that doesn't work, pray.
It's catching on.
And that's just kind of where it stops, and you don't say, "Okay, how does this work?"
"The rest of us barely scrape by.
Seems like it so rarely works.
There's something that's not right.
You need a little introduction to how things work around here.
Anybody else wanna tell me how things work around here?
There's something that's not right.
Well, it certainly seems to pump up the ego.
Am I the only one who has the creeps?
Frank sees McNally, he's gonna blow a nut, or his stack, or whatever it is you blow.
That's not how it works.
Because if anyone gets dragged down in all this, it's gonna be you, not her; that's just the way it works, man.
Shouldn't you be resting up for your big day?
So tell me how this works.
We're practically giving it away.
I think it is working, Cousin!
But it's not gonna help you get over me.
A place off your streets where we can listen to Frank and get our drink on.
What'd you do to the TV?
And we buy this place for nothing.
- You made it work, right?
When he sold me the gym, he didn't believe I could make it work.
So Draft Andrew's working out for you, huh?
Uh, you know, the gym is good.
The truth is, he's doing better than ever.
That's not how it works.
Thanks for letting us know.
Lend us a hand!
Need help?
Actually, no, it still works.
After you lost the baby, I finally got a sense of closure, and now you come over here, and you just start playing more games with me?
I know we were looking for fresh ideas, but these are relatively easy to organize, and they work.
Yeah, so how does this work?
What could you possibly be talking about?
I appreciate you helping me out like this.
Yep, that's sort of how it works when you're pregnant and haven't had the baby yet.
Now, you got to watch out for these twins.
That's how family works.
Get over here and help me.
Here's how it works.
Okay, I just wanna give you a heads-up, all right? It's out there.
- How will that work?
You know how she can be a hassle.
So throw me a bone, will ya, Frank?
Anyway, it works.
Because that's not how it works.
Can I give the pretty lady a hand?
- But I wanna fix this. I wanna fix us.
And I wanna make that work.
I guess it worked.
I wanted you to work it out.
You need something that still works.
I don't get how you have a kid and not give a shit what happens to it.
That last lightning strike fried my generator.
How does it work?
Well, I hope that works out.
That's the way of the world.
Come to lend a hand?
So they asked me to give them a hand.
Yeah, funny how that works.
You know, I gotta say, I kind of envy him.
See how that works?
Need a hand with this diaper change.
It feels like it fits, Marth.
Oh, Roxy, that's sweet. Thank you. But, uh, it's not the way things work in the army.
I wish I was knitting right now.
That's how it works
If it works for both parties, it's a great way to expedite the deal.
That number we gave her better pan out.
- I could use a hand here.
It's a good thing you're the only other person that will see this machine work.
You wanna tell us how it works?
But we've been trying to make this work for a long time,
I'm sure the girl is just here to get some closure.
It probably won't work, but if it does, you're gonna have to move fast, so stay on your toes.
That trick--one two, one two-- damned if it doesn't work.
It's been working so well for you.
Okay. All right.
Works for me.
But if it does...
I want this to work.
Maybe he was drinking before he came down to calm his nerves.
She always likes to stick her oar in.
You know, it doesn't really work like that.
How does it work? [Beep]
And it'll still work?
Maybe this will.
Ugly dolls and fake blood is so Lee.
I'm getting really tired of these robes and this stupid pole.
You like a little nip, sweet cheeks?
Mr Burns! Got five minutes for a chat?
This is the way the construction business works, okay?
And did it?
You see anybody who looks like they're talking to our guy?
Knew it'd work.
I don't want to argue, I don't want to get serious.
Er, guys, shouldn't you be doing something?
Cos I want this to work.
I should be looking for PJ.
All right, maybe you do things differently here.
We're in, but... Maybe it's a bit dark now.
Give the guy a hand.
But you know what it is.
I know what it is.
I hope it works out for you.
Assuming they respond, you'll be fine.
Almost 9:00. I think your boy is gonna stand us up.
I'm on some weird meds, but they must be working, because I'm feeling a lot better now.
Well, that's usually how it works with you.
Meeting dad and... he's coming over for dinner and I'll feel really bad if I blow him out.
Well, we... we, we met for a few drinks and a quick bite to eat, chatted for a few minutes in his car,
I could definitely see her flipping.
I searched for that necklace for 15 years, and now I'm just supposed to help him?
This can work if you want it to work.
Get this done.
But that's how it works.
Your marriage is over.
Certainly if he's as gay as he says he is, Then he'll pass any test with flying colors.
- It really... It's so typical of dad. Selfish.
No, I'm not quite sure I know how this would work.
Wipe that smile off your face, pledge.
Yeah, okay, sounds like a deal.
I guess if you need a hand or something...
Yeah, that get-out-of-jail-free card-- that work for me, too?
Okay. Will do.
There's definitely no excess, and he definitely still works hard in order to make ends meet.
Can you give me a hand?
When you start to hear the voices again, that's how you'll know that this is working.
This is the guy who got you a mailboxfull of roses, who put you in a hot-air balloon, tried to take you away to the Caribbean on a whim. The leafs.
We owe it to each other to try and make this thing work.
Okay, what about whipped cream, would that work?
So that'll work.
Stop being a scaredy-cat it will just take a second how could I get hurt.
that works pretty well.
Last we talked, you said you were sick of selling skis.
How's that working out for you?
But it works pretty good for an antique.
Well, we could've resolved this and moved on, but apparently, ego is going to get in the way.
Yeah, well, that's how it works, kid.

Give me a hand here, boys.
How does this work?

We thought you could use a hand.
How does it work?
Was it love at first sight?
You can't let the what ifs mess with your head.
- And that works?
Don't forget, if you're sticking around for block leave, to let me know.

I wanted her to be OK.

Okay. I'll get right on that.
Okay. Sure.
This is how it works.
I mean, it's not like you to do anything on the fly.
What do you think you are doing? Eh?
Yes, we have to keep going.
So you just gonna stand there scowling at me, or can I have a drink?
You guys want to go grab a drink at the Bent Elbow?

it helps.
Da Flippity Flop, it works!

Whirlwind romance.
There was a man called Gerald Walters who worked at ICI and he did die in a car crash but there was no whirlwind romance with Pamela Sloan.
I want to make it clear, unless this works, I'm against it.
That's how this works, right?
Gotta be something a little off there.
Let's go get me a drink.
This wasn't a spur-of-the-moment killing, brought on by anger or the result of an argument.
OK, go on - how does this experiment work?
Yeah, and I'm not gonna have any place to drink.
I had just about enough of you.
Actually, uh, Naomi, I think you're great and I've had a ton of fun, but... you know, I really just don't think things are gonna work out between us.
I really could use a hand.
But you agree, there's definitely something wrong?
Well, I just wanted to let you know that we found funding for your project.
If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck...
Listen, um, Ekaterina's waiting in the car, so I'm just gonna get right to it.

I am wrapping up with my client on Friday and I may be able to help and come set up.
I've done it dozens of times. it works.

I don't mean to nitpick, but it looks a lot like the rocket ship you made for him last week.
You need a hand?
I should be celebrating my sister's wedding now.
Hey, Boyd, can I give you a hand there?
Why do you have to pick your nose so much?
Can you make that work?"
Same bottle that somebody spiked with shrimp, knowing that he'd, uh, throw a shot back at midnight after finishing work on his hog, sho' nuff.
Private parties full of drunk, crazy girls is a great way to make ends meet.
Either you are gonna get sick of me.
I am gonna get sick of you and your stupid habits. Stop DVR-ing the news.
One of us is just guaranteed to get sick of the other and call it quits?
I'd just like to point out that we could be servicing our customers.
Well, then you better figure something else out because this is chump change.
I just want to know how it works.
Watching a video seems like a waste of time when we could be doing something more productive.
Shouldn't you be out chasing Tyler to the ends of the earth, or are there some hopes and dreams you want to crush around here?
It works for me.

You wouldn't think it does, but it does.
Well, it doesn't work like that.
Tell me, how does it work?
They could be controlling the source and waiting for a meeting to be set up with the colonel.
What the hell did you think you were doing?
I've beenlooking out for your by-lines, keeping up with your stuff.
It works.
That was just a practice spin to show how it works.
Christopher, I know you want to take the lead on this.
Yeah, if it works, which is what we are here to find out.
We got to prove this works.
This doesn't mean that I forgive you, but with time, we'll figure out a way to move on.
Ah, classic, classic George Tucker.
And I'm willing to do whatever it takes this time to make it work.
Ruben, just a hint.
Usually, it's treated with chemotherapy drugs, and they work in about 50% of the patients, but they didn't help Michael.
Does that give you closure?
Why don't you reach out to the DEA and the CIA.
Mm. But that's how it works.
Now they've invited him back as a gesture of goodwill, and he'll finally get some closure on this miserable chapter in his life.
I guess actual medicine can be effective.
- Ha! Classic Ted.
You're one bucket of kfc extra crispy away from giving precious a run for her money.
I'm Johnny storm. "Flame on." That's classic Doug.
You know how that is.
What the hell am I supposed to do? What can you do? Maybe I can catch somebody in Psych.
Hey, Junior, listen, um, there are about 800 reasons why it won't, but, um, for your sake, I hope this works out.
So you fell for him at first sight?
Wow... I can see so clearly!
Is that still a reach for you? Huh? Not financially set for that yet?
Yes, he just dropped in. It was a spur of the moment thing.
If I did, would you give me a hand? Absolutely.
The idea is to learn from these, then, if it's going well, expand.
Mucking in with the best of them.

This guy was just tired of seeing Szymanski getting paid while he scraped by.
So this work for you?
They all say that at least i have closure now.
My husband didn't get closure.
How does this... EMDR thing, how does it work?
Only because you told me this would work.
But I think we're making it work. Right?
Give me a hand.
I'm just wondering if you could help me out.
There's something seriously wrong with this picture.
Going into emergency medicine I like the hands on, that there are procedures that need to be done.
What happened?
First time it worked in my favor.
And how's that working for Henry?
I could use an extra hand on the ship.
Guys, she's gonna lose it.
You look hungover.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
But it works out.
No, it doesn't work like that.
He thinks I'm really angry, and this would give me closure.
I need closure.
My boyfriend told me that it was a good idea to come here and see you for closure, but he was obviously wrong.
Traveling on your own, making decisions on the spur of the moment, taking the risk that things will work out someplace new.
Smash-and-grab-- classic Chris Brown.
- How does this work?
How do I help you turn around and face it?
See, how it all works better?
Is this how it works?
That is not how it works.
- Yeah, that'll work.
I've got some food to get, but I don't really know how this works.
I have the strong impression Kasper Juul behind this.
I might also something hastily responded.
- Yes, now it is good.
Yeah I'm sorry, I didn't mean to stand you up.
Here, Alex, I can help you out with that.
She may be hiding in the closet, for all I know.
What do you think you're doing?
But if you close, I want details.
I'm gonna bust my ass to make it happen.
Maybe being quiet and keeping to yourself is how it works in the Mills family, but that's not how the Dawsons do it.
- I don't even know how to use these buttons.
Yeah, and if that doesn't work, then we go to plan "B"... lock her up and keep her sidelined until you and I figure out a plan "C."
Well, hey, whatever works, whatever...
I got to be careful what's out there about me, okay?
Helps out.
That's how the system works.
I argued against that cowboy hat, but in the end, it worked.
That usually works, but not today.
No, that ship has sailed.
Look, it's working!
Listen, we all got to move on.
Okay, now, the device is powered by kinetic energy, so you've got to dance to make it work.
Uh, Dad, I don't think that's how it works.
Ask the chicken how that's working out.
Want a drink?
Wow. How does it work?
Deputy, give me a hand.
- I dunno how it works.
Is it working?
I can't put my finger on it, okay, but there is something not right about him.
Maybe they would work on you.
I know, and I don't know how it works or what it does, but he goes to work every day, and he's fine.
He's probably stalking them right now.
So how does this work?
Let's try and make this work.
Vast acreage of rented tenements, yielded for a peppercorn.
No, sir, no peppercorn - repayment for a debt.
Oh, classic Chelsea...
This is what it looks like.
But slow and steady-- that's how it cracks.
You and your buddy, you go out drinking.
Your heads are filled with cat urine.
What do you think you're doing?
I'll see if it works.
Well, I wouldn't say we're picking out china patterns, but you know, it's a nice fit.
- I'll explain how that works later.
As long as I can drink while I advise, I'm good with it.
Look, I know how this works.
How's it working out for you?
I try to keep abreast of what's happening in the field.
Well, you should be at home, studying.
A child smiles and sits up and walks, and a couple have that together.
- Give me a hand with this.
You got it, boss. I'll stay close.
I think we're doing too much brainstorming and not enough good old-fashioned remembering.
- That's the move right there.
Is that the way to go?
Come on, I'll catch you up on where we are.
I figured I'd step up to help, go with 'em.
Classic Pilo.
I don't need the stress of playing guitar with my friends every few weeks.
Maybe we'll give Lieutenant Daniels closure after all.
Just give me some damn help!
- I'll make it work.
Let me give you a hand.
Oh! Something's wrong.
Aah! Something's wrong!
You obviously don't know how this works.
Need a hand?
Okay, let's do that.
When I see you with Myriam, it'll never work out between the two of us.
It'll work out with her testimony.
Let me know how that works out.
You scared it might work?
A-and it's working, too.
This is what she would have been collecting.
- Does it work?
Yeah, but do we know if that even works?
The police have had trouble locating him, so our mutual friend thought I might be able to lend a hand.
Would you give me a hand up?
All I know is I can't get sucked into it again.
Which is why I wanted to bring you in the loop.

I feel like that's not gonna work.
That's how it works.
- But, umm... when it's working, you shouldn't have to try so hard.
Do you think they finally got sick of all that Donna Summer?
Well, they wanna watch themselves!
Oh, help me out with these, will you, Bromley?
How does this work?
You two have to get clear of the building before the guards realize something's wrong.
Why don't we go out tonight?
Then you call me, and then we can hit the city.
Maybe you can help me out?
If not, Miss Meade will be right across the street to let me know.
Just figured I'd get a jump start on the day, clean up, take some things off your plate.
Just what the hell do you think you're doing?
All the more reason I could use a little help.
While I was helping out a friend, one of my other friends was looking for advice.
Honey, I'm in.
She looks just like the Virgin Mary.
Oh... Shut up.
It's in Hollywood, so if she gets it maybe she'll meet her father.
You and me work.
* I've got a lot to take * Ok, great.
So, why do you think it'll work for me?
It's for you, helping you get closure.
Yeah, because that's how it usually works... treatment fails, and the patient gets better.
Listen, I would have done anything to make this work.
Luann, I hope we're still on Thursday for collecting used cell phones for the troops.
Tell me Henry Winchester's grandson isn't curious to see if it works.
But, sadly, I can't trust you, either.
You know this doesn't work, right?
Hey, you need a hand with that?
I am a trained commando. It won't work.
Think I'm hurtin' without your gas stations?
I want to learn from an expert so next time maybe I can help Bobby out myself.
Look, Freddy, you know how this works.
Help me.
- No, it's ok.
Make it work.
I'll get right to the point.
It's what I could do to help her turn things around.
I'm gonna cut right to the chase.
You're demolishing me.
What do you think you're doing? Okay.
Therapy is p-p-painful, but it's working.
But you have the key? That's not the way safe-deposit boxes work.
Could you hand me the...
- You must be beat.
It's love at first sight?
Your fashion blogger pal wants to have a drink with us.
But said with assurance, conviction, it works.
This is Dendi through and through.
So we're all gonna have a nice walk through town, have a good cry, and then move on.
I thought I'd help out and start learning the trade.
Want some help?
You want some help?
You know, if you could coordinate with my offices and keep me apprised of any developments, that'd be great.
They figure that works in Mexico, so it'll work here.
Give me a helping hand.
Here's how this works.
They can do cocktails Thursday between 5:30 and 6:30, if that works for you.
If this is gonna work, you are gonna have to trust me.
I just... I really needed this to work, you know?
Long ago, I was going through some rough years, trying to make ends meet.
I'm just helping out.
You got to get rid of her.
Is that work?
I'm not sure if this is gonna work, but...
I don't work no other way.
- And if it does?
- If it does, Hatake won't have any more excuses.
Your daughter, she... she told me how it works with the Supreme.
So, how does this work?
You know how this works.
There's something wrong with me.
If we're gonna make this work, we have to find a way to compromise.
Whatever you decide to do, we will make it work.
You grow up the way I did, that's the way it works.
After all my times here, after all our times here with the children, it's time to move on.
As a friend, I'm telling you not to force an issue for the short-term emotional satisfaction it can have.
That's not how it works, not in this neighborhood.
I know how this works.
How this works.
That's the price you pay for great gams.
If someone could give me a hand.
Yeah, I know how it works.
I don't even care if it works.
Oh, torture... it only works in giving our rage a place to go.
Nuts is right.
All you want to do is to make it work.
Do you feel like it's working for you?
Let's get a drink, huh?
We should be feasting on the enemy's finest meats and cheeses.
Look, all I know is that it works.
That'd be like standing up a baby.
Well, we just ended so suddenly, we never got to work on us, and I feel like if you work hard enough at any relationship, you can make it work.
How does it work?
All I want to hear is that it works and you got it solved.
We will call it the police boys and you have a deal.
- Cool. Deals, deals, deals, everywhere.
All right, I knew that wasn't gonna work, I'm sorry.
Just a few friends over for drinks at my place?
Can you help me out?
It's in your head.
You know how that works.
At least tell me how this works.
How often does that go well?
I was lucky enough to find my Russian bride several years ago with the assistance of a foreign affair, and I assure you that it can work for you as well.
So then you have to say if it worked for John, you know, certainly, maybe, maybe it could work for me.
I was lucky enough to meet Tanya through a foreign affair, actually, so, yeah, I'm a great example of how it can work, and it does work.
Instant sparks.
Even though she speaks very little English and I speak no Russian, it was just instant sparks.
I really want to make it with her, you know.
And maybe that works and maybe that doesn't.
I'm gonna try and I'll give it my best shot.
If it depends on me, I will make it work.
Hopefully it works out with us.
For some reason, something just doesn't seem right, but I think everything's gonna be all right.
We want to believe that it's gonna work out.
I thought you agreed to keep us in the loop.
It looks like you don't need any help staying in the loops.
Listen, I'm sorry to cut to the chase, but I have a meeting later.
So whoever did it is walking the streets of Boston right now and there's gonna be a manhunt like we haven't seen since Dallas in '63.
- No, it works.
I have a mild case of haphephobia, and you need to read up on it if you want this to work.
This is how it works.
You know, sometimes she gives you a hand, and then sometimes she pisses right down your leg.
She has five cats, so her place probably smells like cat pee instead of beer and smoke.
Cross that bridge when we come to it. Oh, my God!
Yeah, but shouldn't you and her be tryin' to make it work?
Look, if you want to see it in action, I can take a swab from you right now.
She should be rehearsing my speech by now.
I'm gonna take the lead at DollaHyde. The meeting was at 10:00.
Yeah, just want a little help with something.
I need your help with something.
Where I come from, we call that "chicken shit."
Here, let me help you with that.
Girls, give me a hand with this, huh?
If I could've seen him, I don't know... may have felt like closure.
No, but she keeps writing me letters... and I think that it would help to give us some closure. Which is psychologically... not without value.
Not having closure with Alex Vause... would be the least of your problems.
But I was really trying to turn a new leaf.
I just haven't met anyone else against the bypass and also who seems to know how things work in this town.
I'm not sure how well that would work for me, but...
Patience, bring the hooks.
And to be honest, you look a - little hung over.
You're right, doesn't work.
So please just get over yourself and give me a hand.
Those are the rules.
You know the deal.
But those were the last cookies!
Well, I'm not telling you to marry him, and I can't promise that it's gonna work out, but did you have a good time with him?
- I told you it would work. - Oh, Swatello!
- And so none of your business.
But can you give me a hand?
As a courtesy, we wanted to update you on the Whitaker case.
I will search and let you know if I find anything worth your time.
Well, I would have called it just a hunch, but that works, too.
Yeah. Classic Craig, right?
Let me tell you how it works in the USA, Dimitri.
- And I'm the only one who knows how that works.
The piñata on this can turned red.
That is exactly how it works!
- You guys ready for closure?
- Is this working?
I know how this works, you lowball me, and I give you an actual dollar value and then we meet in the middle somewhere.
There is no guarantee that this will work.
I knew that'd work.
Henry, lend him a hand.
You find ways to pass time... eat, talk... mostly watch, which is what we should be doing.
To make it work, you gotta love them.
- All right, boy, you got it.
So how does this work?
Okay, great.
This is how it works!
That's not how this works.
How what works?
- Olivia, you know how this works.
You have to admit this is working for us.
Hey, guys, look at Lauren spinning out.
How does this work?
Tom can be a wuss.
You've got to go crazy once in a while or you'll just instantly become a bitter, old, British alcoholic man.
Yeah. That's how it works.
Grab some water, take a break.
If you're trying to break me, it's not gonna work.
She looks just like Sid, doesn't she?
He just helps me.
I'd rather just clean-slate this one.
- Can I get a hand here?
But I think that's why we work?
I know. I just wanted it to work because I love the name so much.
No need to mull it over.
That's how it works.
I told you it would work.
And... I really wanted it to work out for Stan.
Mind if I have a drink?
Oh, come on, give me a hand wrapping it, will you?
I hope that it works out for you.
- How's it work?
Do you not think I want this to happen?
Besides, all we have is enough cash for a quick drink and a taxi ride to the airport.
Back in the '80s, you couldn't keep up with all the new dance styles.
- Yeah, it's working.
Let's see how this thing works.
I know there's some people who don't think it'll work, But we're gonna prove them wrong.
Let me first explain how it works.
And if not, he'll have beers in his lunch.
- That's not how it works.
Yeah, look, I'm gonna give it to you straight. We're looking for a necromancer.
- I've generated a few ideas involving social media that I think might do the trick.
Not to bury the lede but Andy Brooks came to my house.
They come back, we'll just make it work.
But that's the deal, right?
The kitchen is the main battle ground... but I've got them in training so we'll see how that goes.
It's expensive, but we... obviously want it to work.
You know what, I may not know how all of this works, the dream hacking... but at least I know when I've overstayed my welcome.
I knew it would work.
I can help out around the house, buy groceries, build stuff, rip shit out of walls as needed.
My sister's pregnant, so I'm, like, staying at her place, and just kind of helping her out a little bit, getting my ducks in a row.
Now, I'm gonna open the divider to the girls' gym, and if you don't find a dance partner within ten seconds, there is something very wrong with you!
Hey, B. Give your old man a hand, will ya?
I don't know what you think we're running here, but this is not fight club.
- Uh, give me a hand with this?
- Are you telling me to go home?
How does that work exactly?
It makes perfect sense. You needed closure.
But I'm not gonna take the bait.
See if that works out for you.
I really don't. My point is don't overthink it, Jess.
this works too.
Works every time.
That's the Fae way.
So it worked?
I think it's working.
I think it's working.
Do you believe this will actually work? That we can finally have some semblance of peace in this city?
I know how it works.
I heard you might need a hand.
It doesn't work that way.
I'll come find you if I need a hand.
I don't think that's how it works, but thank you.
Let me show you how it works.
I say give me a hand, sidekick.
Please just let this work out.
How does that work?
All right, fine, Morty, you party pooper buzzkill! Boo, boo!
Just wanted to get you up to speed.
You're supposed to be building a case on Voight, and you got nothing.
It's working!
Okay... well, it-it's working.
I mean, help me out, guys-- even if you're really stoned, you notice if a car's going too fast.
We know how this works.
Can you, um... just keep me in the loop?
She could be dying.
You know how it works.
No, that is not how drug dealers work.
She just got under my skin.
But you gotta move on, right?
But I get through to the kids.
It worked.
We'll go to the track and hang.
Okay, so how it usually works.
Yeah, do you need a hand?
You must get pretty sick of people doing weird stuff in front of you all the time, just 'cause they think you won't remember.
How does that work?
- Want a hand with that?
- You need a hand?
- Okay, yeah, deal.
we're gonna make it work, okay?
I mean, we're gonna make it work, though.
Does it work?
"These attacks are often incorrectly "diagnosed as miscarriages, and for the process to work, the fetus must be a blood relative to the Aswang."
I might be thinking of chimpanzees.
If you're here to shake me down again, Carter, now's not the time.
For this to work, it needs to be injected directly into the brain.
That means it's working.
If this works, we may actually live long enough for you to collect.
I'll need your help.
This is the only way this is gonna work.
Well, how does it work?
Just give me a hand.
Yes. How does it go?
Of course it isn't. But that's how it works.
Ok, ladies, you know how this works.
How does that work?
She must be trying to send me some type of message or something.
What if it doesn't work?
So I tracked down her dental records, but I have not turned them over to the coroner because Jane Doe's death was ruled a homicide, and if it is Ana, I could very well be linking Mike to a murder.
Let's go see if this works.
It comes and it goes, and it works out, like, maybe 30% of the time, and even then it's... it's a lot of work.
How's that working out for you?
♪ Don't put dirt on my grave just yet ♪
Hey, look, I hate to bring this up tonight, but I'm having a little trouble with Maddie.
You know how those things go?
I just need all of this to work.
In order for this to work, you got to let go of this jealousy thing once and for all and trust me.
Mind giving me a hand here, Carlos?
You know how it works, where the money's at.
Need a little help, Finch.
Mind giving me a hand?
H-How does it work?
I mean, isn't that how it goes?
How do we know if it works?
I suspect Grandmother's venting her spleen about the party.
Make it work.
Yeah, okay.
Look, I've been dealing with my son having cancer for almost 10 years now, and most of the people that come here every week, it's because it's the one place we can chat, get a little Pinot buzz
Oh, wow. I'm getting run down from all this hosting.
And it does take practice, but it really works for them.
I mean, we're dating, that's kind of how it works.
Nobody advocates a hysterectomy on a whim.
Is this our life now... you going from one job to another, always finding some reason why it's not good enough?
Then maybe it will work out for me, too, with Al.
Set out to make something grow, and it does.
But maybe there is something wrong with me, with both of us.
Does it work?
And it's working.
We're gonna make this work. Make it better.
I was happy to lend a hand.
The upside is I'm getting real good at not giving a shit.
Well, if that works so well, then why can't I stay at your place?
Well, that's not exactly how it works.
But anyone who talks about work tonight has to take a drink.
That's not even the way it works, you fuckin' idiot. Yeah?
Just checking in.
You mind if I give you a hand?
How's it work?
All right. Have at it.
Ooh. Yes, I'm really getting the hang of it now.
Before we can be together, you need to have closure with Amber.
I don't know how to get closure.
And the next, you're supposed to be friends and pretend you're never in love and then get closure so you can do it all over again.
♪ Oh, have we given up? - I'm ready to move on.
"Veep's campaign needs a helping hand."
Let's see if this works.
Indeed it does.
I don't understand what they can be talking about for six days.
You know, what's weird is that saying literally applies when I'm talking to you.
You know how it is.
Uh-oh, it's working too well.
Well, I hope that works out for you.
We got to go to the hospital. I might be losing the baby.
Then let's make sure it works.
No dear, this business doesn't work like that.
My daughter could learn from you.
That's how it works over here.
She can get closure.
I really hope this works.
You need to get that sort of thing sorted out before you set off.
This better work.
Would you mind keeping me in the loop in case you find anything else?
That doesn't look right.
But it only works if there's another way out of that room.
Wait a minute. Something's wrong here.
- Uh, can we just cut to the chase?
I can literally do it standing on my head.
Zombies don't move well.
It's colder than a goblin's ass out here, huh? Ha! Ha!
I am moving on.
I need to move on.
But I mean it when I say I want to move on.
So much for my moving on.
He may be bleeding out.
Closure.
- Yeah, I've totally cut back, and not that it's any of your beeswax, but I've also cut back on... you know.
Apparently, he met a girl at work, and it was love at first sight.
How does that work money-wise?
So how does it work?
You know, some people are not so averse to rubberized help.
Oh, if you find yourself getting too excited think about your grandfather emptying his colostomy bag. Works like a charm.
Oh, hey, that thing with my Grandpa and the colostomy bag totally worked.
I impulse-remarried a depraved lunatic who can't even get it up for me.
You start fucking the actresses the whole show will go down in flames.
No, that's working well now, actually.
Care to lend a hand? Oh, God, no.
- Make it work.
Herrmann, Otis, give me a hand!
- I just thought things were going so well, why not?
Give me a hand.
To be in the business, I'll probably need to shove his ass out of the fire.
I'm getting really sick of this.
It's freezing in here.
Maybe this'll give me some of that closure or whatever it is they call it.
Just because a case is closed doesn't mean you have closure.
I'll take the ad, you just follow in the rear.
And give me a hand in here?
All right, Charlie, this is the part where you tell me how this works, how I get out of here.
Charlie, I need this to work.
They carry water in them, but it-it works. (chuckles)
I don't think that's how it works.
In order for this to work, you must believe you are these people.
They should be sucking your dick right now.
You know, I'm getting pretty damn tired of everybody telling me where I should be and what I should be doing.
Fiona... can you give me a hand with the skewers?
Not ready to punch my ticket yet.
Hi. Need a hand with something?
No one wants this to work more than me.
So you better get out there, or I am going to lose it!
How about triple 7
Well, can you help me out with this?
She left in a bit of a bad mood.
Oh, my God, you've gotta be kidding.
Uh, well, that's kind of how this whole thing works.
She doesn't understand how word searches work.
Does that even work?
I just wanted to come by as a courtesy, you know... do unto others and so forth.
It's an old trick, but it still works.
I tell you what to do, you do whatever the hell you want, somehow it all works out, and I'm the dumb-ass losing sleep over it.
Howard, you in on this?
But I have two jobs just to keep us afloat, and I wasn't home till 8:00, and she was gone.
Curtis, give James a hand upstairs, all right?
Or the waitresses at Hooters or whoever it works on.
And I'm getting kind of tired of defending myself.
Works better if he's wet.
No, I'm not falling for that again.
We're gonna move forward and leave this shit behind.
She could be destroying evidence as we speak.
- Shit.
That's how things work in my world.
You're going to be great, Dad.
But, um, you know, it's just so typical Clark.
_
Here, uh, let me show you how it's gonna work from here on in.
For a werecoyote, expect it to work within seconds.
Who knows if it'll even work if you can find someone who can teach you.
Well, there's definitely something wrong with it.
But a bolt of lightning happens to be exactly what we need right now.
If this works, it might kill me, too.
Promise me you'll make it work.
You need to learn how things work.
It's classic Al Capone.
She worked hard in school, she helped out around my church, she taught Bible study to the preschoolers.
He should be teaching me.
Yeah, how's that working out for you, Pat?
There's something wrong!
You need closure.
But if it works... oh, my God.
- I know how it works.
Names - not my area.
Is that like love at first sight? Huh!
I know how this works, you lowball me, and I give you an actual dollar value and then we meet in the middle somewhere.
'Cause I didn't know if it would work or not.
If it's just one of Bo's manifestations, and if it works...
- If it works.
I gotcha.
I'll give you a push.
You think you could lend us a hand here, bud?
I don't know that that would work on Dash.
I know how much you wanted it to work out with her.
Let's meet up for a drink in front of the square.
So how does it work?
This chip prevents Bo's signature from showing up on their sensors, but Bo only.
Do you maybe want to go get a drink somewhere else?
But we can make it work because you don't have any other choice.
Making it work...
I'm just making sure it works out in my favor.
So, the only one of us who has any understanding of how this thing works is grounded.
So how does this work?
Even if this procedure works, which it never has, he dies.
Yeah, tomorrow night works.
How's that working out for you?
She broke off her relationship with Nicholas Orman to be with you.
I know opening a restaurant is risky, but I can make this work.
Right. I don't have much time to make this happen.
I acted on impulse, which I should never do.
Baby, you need a hand?
Catherine needs to move on.
But if you give her the necklace, she might actually move on.
I can't. Uh, can you let know if that necklace shows up?
No, no, it does not work like that.
You actually have to put that broom on the floor for it to work.
You and Caroline still need some closure.
Shouldn't you be occupying Wall Street or something?
Look, I'm just saying I know what works on me because I'm hard working and I'm dedicated, but it would really be interesting to see if it worked on somebody who was almost completely sedentary.
That would have been better if you hadn't worn my trench coat, but sure.
I've got to keep up with my people, haven't I?
I'll keep this in a sealed envelope close to my heart, and we'll see if it works.
I don't mind if it don't.
Okay. But this goes both ways.
- There's something wrong with that kid.
So was it love at first sight?
Yeah, but gay bars are always full of straight girls, fresh off breakups.
We'll make it work.
Sugar, I've had a little too much to drink, so you're gonna just have to get to the point.
And the way Hoyt said it it was love at first sight.
One coffee, coming up.
It's Dad all over again.
I-I should be watching NCIS right now.
You know, it would probably work better if you plugged it in.
Which we can make disappear now with our liquid eraser. Works for me.
Not that there's anything wrong with you now, huh?
Well, I would've if I thought something like that would work.
You're confident it can work?
Hodgins, can you give me a hand?
How's that working out for you?
No, that's not the way this works.
- Do you need a hand, Miriam?
Yeah, I understand the mechanics of it, shithead.
Well, whatever you're doing works for you.
Sure, but I don't think it would work.
She doesn't really know how these games work, doesn't know when to talk and when to shut up.
Miss Truepenny, shouldn't you be off hunting Aurelius?
At least we know it works.
Come on, give me a hand.
- I don't know how great he was, but he was all right to drink with.
I'll get right to the point.
Dad, it's working.
- Getting kind of sick of it.
All the hand-me-downs smell like cat pee and beer.
I'm gonna cut to the chase.
I'm getting pretty sick of your mouth!
Well... all right.
That's how it's going to be, is it?
That's how it's going to be.
Do you eat--how's that work?
But it will work.
Yeah. Guys wig out, you know?
There's a chill out there.
You need some help there?
Let's hope this works and the German guy shows up.
You know how that works.
Thanks for helping out, Baxter.
I mean, how are we gonna make ends meet when the kid actually gets here?
I really need you to pitch in, Mom. All right, all right.
How does it work?
Oh. How's that working for you?
This better work, or it's both our asses.
Well, at least he doesn't have a beast to help him out any more.
You know, you wanna be careful about these threats.
If you could maybe just give me a hand.
Well, I... I'll get right on that.
- That's how this works.
- For the love of God, will you be quiet for a single moment?
You guys can let me know how that turns out.
Now the good news: it is working!
- It's making me crazy, but it's working. - Yeah.
He's the only one who understands the light board!
I don't think it'll work, though.
Shall we cut to the chase?
That's how this works.
But we make it work.
But I guess I just don't know... how it would work.
There's something off here, Emmett.
Well, what are the odds it could work?
You could do two years standing on your head.
I know your head must be spinning right now.
All I have are my grandma's old klezmer records, and I still haven't quite figured out how to sync up the beats, but it's not bad, right?
Wonder if you can help us out here.
If this is our guy, he's got to be brokering the deal.
You have no idea how this works, do you?
Fiona, could I get a woman's help in the kitchen?
I've been taking care of myself for a very long time now with only a few minor hiccups along the way, been doing a fairly good job of it.
He's probably doing homework or something.
Need some help?
Well, glad to hear someone's is.
Although, it would be just like Sally to do something epic right now and rip her way out of your chest.
- Okay, deal.
So how does this thing work?
Now, or you're gonna be grounded for a week.
Let me, let me tell you how this works.
Give me a hand here. I'm-I'm not asking you to put the gun down. I just need, I just need a hand.
If it works, and it's going to work, it'll be more destructive than all the bombs dropped in all the wars in history put together.
Yeah and Noll was at all the robberies.
I'm disappointed in you.
As soon as her lap-band kicks in, she's gonna be gorgeous.
Oh, my God. It's working!
But then it backfires, 'cause I'm thinking about you even more, and...
I've never had a bodyguard before, so I'm not sure how this works.
So, how does this work?
Something's wrong with this room.
- Okay, yeah, right.
I don't know why this works.
Okay, Stella. All right.
Hey, Raven, tell us again how this is gonna work.
I love you and someday we'll make this work.
I mean, when it first launches I'll go back and forth, but hopefully it takes off and it'll become a full-time job.
Pitch in for Ed's retirement cake?
But for that to mean anything, Mr. Casey... you have to trust me.
Sometimes you just got to move on.
You need some help?
Give me a hand.
Sometimes that works.
You know how it works!
You're going to do what ever I tell you to do because that's the way this relationship works.
Is that how it's gonna work?
If anybody starves, it should be them.
Gretchen... do you believe in love at first sight?
Too bad, 'cause it's working.
I hope this works.
- How does this work for us?
Is it working?
Actually, I was wondering if you two might want to lend a hand.
You guys wanna come over to my buddy's bar for a few drinks?
You have to move on.
Oh, Max, don't put that in there, ahh--okay.
[ chuckling ] that's the whole point of this place.
Look, I'll directly come to the point.
Okay, if she's going to blow us off, she'd better put a little more effort into it than that.
I haven't checked up on him yet.
He'll make it work.
Hey, need a hand?
- but I hope it works.
Dammit, I hope this works.
Is this how it works?
There's something wrong with them.
I know how this works by now.
Guzzle Buddy! What's a Guzzle Buddy, and how does it work?
And I don't just mean I don't understand how it works.
I know how this works.
Yeah, I can feel them, but that's not how it works.
I sold you that land for next to nothing.
I'm telling you, private charter is the only way this will work.
- Was it love at first sight?
Whatever his plan, it's happening now.
They don't look bad from a distance, but get up close, best watch your ass.
Heroin ain't working out. Neither's the whorehouse.
And lastly, I figured you might be kind of sick of Chinese food, or as you call it, "food."
You don't want this to work.
Do you need a hand?
You know how this works.
It worked before, it'll work again.
But if it works, it'll be worth it, you know?
I think it's working.
Your wife's birthday... you sounded serious, and I'm trying to make it work, but I'm gonna have to call in more staff, pay overtime.
Let me cut to the chase.
I come to take my boy back from your boys, and do not be thinking that I believe them able to organise themselves to such a degree without their master offering a helping hand!
That'd be closure, huh?
I want it to work, and I'm just trying to-- Make sure I don't screw it up.
I wanted to make it work with you.
Oh, I believe it's working already.
Time to see if this works.
I wasn't really a believer in love at first sight until I met you.
it works every time.
Yeah, strip clubs aren't really my idea of fun.
No. No, no, no, no. That's not how this works.
That's putting the cart before the horse, and that's...
I thought I was giving you closure.
And how exactly would that work?
Tom has something wrong with his butt.
I know we can make this work.
Yeah, I was thinking maybe stand-up.
If we can't bring him back, we're definitely going to need an extra set of hands.
So it works like the holodeck.
I want to make this work, I do, but I...
That... how would it work?
Well, then, they're working. Right?
W... so how does that work?
So, how's this thing work?
I've been moonlighting over there, taking some shifts, just to see if I get along with his partner.
Do you think Gabriella can make a comeback?
I'm gonna make it work with Hank.

It's better to just put your head down, Get the job done,
It was eating me up inside, that I was sitting in that jail cell rotting while Morgan was out there free as a bird.
I can't believe it actually worked.
You guys need a hand?
You've been dating her a month, and as a guy who knows how to treat a woman, [singsong voice] this is how we do it.
I mean, even if I wanted to try and make this work, which I guess I kind of do, it's just like I'm not sure I know how.
If you just open yourself up, I'm telling you.
I know this is very hard for you to understand, but there is a certain amount of closure necessary for me where this woman is concerned.
See how this works?
How does that work, him playing in the NFL?
Which is what I thought made us work.
Looks like it works.
I'm getting tired of this nagging.
I kept trying to make it work.
Well, thanks for letting me know.
I'd like to take lead on this one.
You know how this works, son.
Hey. I figured you might be drinking.
How does... how does Friday night work for you guys?
Can you feel it working? Oh, yeah.
How does that work, then?
I think that that works.
And it's working.
Ms. Berry, you are barely scraping by and you have the nerve to come in here and ask for special treatment when you haven't earned it?
Okay, uh, see if this works.
How does that work?
I made it hoping we could celebrate, but it works on a sad tummy, too.
Please tell me it's working.
'Cause if you are, it's working.
I'll give you a call, we'll get together.
If it works, too bad for you.
Two things... how does w... how does this work?
Maybe it will.
So why don't we just cut to the chase?
I just told her that's the way the business works.
"That's how the business works," means "shut up and do it."
She's scared and vulnerable, and you tell her, "that's how it works."
No, I've been trying to get information, but they're just not releasing anything yet.
Am I gonna be the only one to address this big elephant in the room?
I will deny ever saying this, but sometimes shooting someone can and it should bring closure.
I even think that it could help me turn a page, to leave the past behind.
He gave me an e-mail address, but it doesn't work.
It doesn't work!
Can you buzz me in?
I'm getting sick of getting yelled at for trying.
So watch out.
But believe me, I want this to work.
All that said, you help us out... maybe we look the other way.
I don't know how this works. I've never done this.
Least you could do is lend me a hand.
Hey, give me a hand.
In order for this to work, it has to be real.
Let me get this straight, Ms. Bingum.
- And it's working.
- Oh, is that how it works?
It was about respect, closure.
Okay. On it.
If there's a key to how this stuff works, you'll find it in there.
I'm sure he'll lend a hand.
Not sure this will work.
I can't promise it'll work.
get you up and running and back fighting the good fight, which is gonna be cool.
Running away on a whim just because the men are drunk?
I'm assuming former lovers qualify.
Even when things are less than ideal between us, it works.
Give me a hand with this thing.
See? It totally works.
For this to work, Woodford can't know you're going in.
You have to BE doing your household.
I'm not gonna dick around with you. You are in a shit storm of trouble here.
Yeah, but it works, though.
How does it work?
You know, if he's bothering you.
Hey, how about a little help?
8 out of 10 times, it works.
I don't know if it will work with Lord Julien, but thank you.
And I want to make ends meet...
Ask Ramírez to give you a hand.
If your father were alive, Ramírez would have given him a hand.
She got stood up at the empire state building last night, and she caught a really bad cold.

Will you give me a hand?
It's not the 1st time we help out.

All right, held my first husband. It should... do the trick for me.
Maybe it's time to let it go.
I just got stood up by Chicken Truitt.
Please, Dinah... let me tell you how this works.
Because it feels like I might be yelling.
Shouldn't you be working?

Fed up how?
You know who would've been helpful with all this?
Did you really think that would work?
But believe me, I want this to work.

I wish it could've worked out, Diane.
I mean, I don't like the marijuana part, but I'm glad you're doing so well.
But someone who knows it'll work but won't help because he's scared of being teased by a bunch of sycophants?

Could use a hand, G.
That's how it works, pretty much.
Mm. Just think... in two weeks, we can be doing this at the Hagia Sophia.
(chuckles) I'll get right to it, Bess.
I know these folks are your people, okay but this hocus-pocus stuff isn't sitting well with me.
There are laws in France but in Corsica there aren't.
It's tricky. lt doesn't always work.
You have to amit this is working for us.
It looke like you neee a han.
I'm trying to turn over a new leaf.
Looks like you need a lift, soldier.
- Want some help with that?
And I'm getting damn tired of losing our best and brightest to Hydra.
You know, I could help out around here.
Well, this investigation that my partner and I are here on, it's... it's big.
You know, if you want any pointers on how to fight this crazy crap, I'm willing to fill you in... you know, what kills what.
How does it work?
She cleaned hotel rooms just to make ends meet.
Listen, it's not gonna work with ma, okay?
I'll show you helpful.
Is it working?

Hey, you need a hand with that?
...to make ends meet.
Jeremy almosts that hooked.
From what I hear, that's not how that works, but if you want-- All right.
Maybe in ten years, when it's cost-effective, but, for now, everyone's just trying to make it work.

This is how it works.
I just hope it works.
That's not how this works...

But George's car accident doesn't add up.

Oi, Ying, come and give us a hand with something.
Hey, Rick, you want to give me a hand with this?

Classic lefty!
Not how it works, dummy.
You're supposed to be out making deliveries.
- I came to the tree of time hoping to reconnect with raava And turn on the avatar state again. But it's not working.
I bet this normally works, doesn't it?
Yeah, they think I'll get bored and hang up, but they picked the wrong retired guy with nothing to do.
All right, listen, Rodney, I'm gonna get right to it.
You know how this works.
But the idea that you can hack off what is effectively one of its limbs and on a cellular level messages crank into action, a whole new plant grows, a perfect biological replication of the original, that is pretty kick-arse.
But when I straw-polled a few people in the hall to see whether there was any truth to the rumour that you might be digging around on behalf of a certain young journalist, not a single person... a single person was prepared to tell me that was crazy thinking.

I'm glad to see this Alex thing is really working out.
How does it work?
I can make it here, I can make it work.
How does this work, exactly?
And we both know how it plays out.
Whatever works, right?
Now, if I were you, I'd like to be sipping a nice glass of champagne on our first flight to nowhere, instead of a sitting duck in a jail cell.
Well, I love how you just switch it around so you can make it fit...
I should be making a lot more money.
I put the plates into NVLS, so hopefully we get a hit.
No, I talked with some C.I.s, some guys who run with robbery crews, but no dice, still working on it.
I hope this works.
- So how does this work?
I just wanted to help amy move on.
You don't want to blow a gasket and bleed out all over the floor.
How does it work?

Look, I don't want to hurt you, but I will if you don't tell me how it works.
I think that the two of you should stop whining like two little schoolgirls who weren't invited to the dance and be happy that your friends, your very dear friends, have found a way to make it work, especially after all the hell those two have been through.

It's working; keep going.
Could he be tweaking it to exploit the split-second gap from when a stock price is set to when it's publicly posted?

Is there someone that can help you out?
Deal.
Pop goes the weasel.
Need more hands here.
You want me to tell you getting dumped didn't hurt?

If it's going to happen, I'll tell you. It will happen fast.
Uh, do you... do you want a hand?
Do you want this to work or not?
Uh, 'cause... sooner or later, you're gonna get tired of the same cars driving down it.
That's how it works.
But if it works...
Need a hand?
-Okay, um... -How does this even work?
Your mom and Hopper are just walking in there like bait.
Typical kazawitz play to bail on a loser.
(exhales) Can I offer a hand?
Oh, Lauren, we're still on for later, right?
Two hundred years ago, our people were little more than dirt farmers, struggling just to survive.
But until we hit it big, we're moving back in with you guys!
It was a hit in Japan in 1992 and right now, let's make it a hit in our living room.
Deej, let me help. Yeah, I'll give you a hand, too.
I think there may be something wrong with this world. Something hiding underneath.
That's how this place works, right?
She was supposed to give me a hand on something.
We don't know how the hosts work, and I think there's something wrong with them.
He's probably fucking her right now.
- No, that's not how it works.
I don't have the first clue.
But I feel like I'm screwing up all the time.
So I have to skedaddle right now.
They're gonna be waiting for me in Sara's old room.
We gotta get some drinks in us, all right?
And I'll take Gen Highway...
Really got to work on getting to the point.
Well, then you understand that you and me in the same room, it's never going to work.
I help take care of the kids, I do a little light housekeeping, part-time cooking, drive carpools.
I'm about to freak out!
Trust me, it works.
In our defense, we never thought it'd work this well.
In case this doesn't work out, I gotta return this puppy.
You have got to make this happen.
- Oh, why is that so effective?
I knew it wouldn't work forever.
And it's working.
For a pittance, you'll risk your life to protect someone else's fortune?
The two of us didn't work out but I know you'll be fine.
Maybe something's wrong with her.
You need to look out for that riff-raft on the ferry
I just wanted you to know about it
- This truly is an awful mess
- No - Come and give me a hand with this
Come and help him out
It seems like everyone but me is ready to forgive and forget
The RAM chips could be losing their data even as we speak.
It appears to be working.
Got a buddy that comes in every now and then that helps me out.
I told you that if you wanted to give me a hand at the bar, you're more than welcome.
He could be doing this to other families.
Listen, I really... I didn't even think that it was gonna work.
It's a long shot, but you're strong, that's why I chose you.
And what if it doesn't work?
If they can, you walk away. You don't look back.
I know you think this can work, but it can't.
Okay, you know what? This ain't gonna work.
Then you should do that, 'cause I'm afraid this ain't working out.
Why don't you ask him for a pint?
- I pray everything works out for him.
It could be an owner of a sports team inviting him to sit in a box at a... at an all-star game or some leader of an African republic looking for a-a handout.
Howard!
I'm perfectly happy to give you a boost.
If it works, you wouldn't have to rely on just a disguise.
And it works?
Why don't you come over here, show me how it works?
He walked to his bus stop thinking about what he could trade or what he could do that week o make ends meet;
But it was good because now there can be closure.
And it'll help you move forward.
They hire white folks and bend black folks
You want me to go the party with you? Be your wingman?
I was basically like, "AA doesn't work."
Hey, maybe that'll work for me.
Turns out they needed my statement to make something like that stick.
Well, if it works, it's money well spent.
If you need to try out a sourcing technique on someone you're sleeping with, you're doing something very wrong.
We may be drawing a line, but... who's to say you can't choose to stay on this side of it?
That's how this house works.
I have... let's just call them impulse control issues.
How does this work cash-wise?
I just wanted to visit again to see if there was some impediment we could help with, or if something in the offer isn't clear?
Let's see how she does now.
- Oh, okay. That's fine.
Yo, give me a hand with this.
All right, let me help.
Is that how it works, you can think of your first kiss and just be happy?
- Give me a hand!
But how does that work?
Leave all this behind. A new start.
I just went into the store to see if there was anything I could do and I found this in the bread aisle. I don't how long it's been there.
Okay, I'm gonna need an update from Granger.
Oh, now we're good, here it is.
Guaranteed to help you find closure.
Right, all right.
I'm just trying to make a buck!
I liked it. Hmm, time to move on.
When it's working, but it's not working.
I don't think it's working.
That's not how this works.
You had Kendra and I training for the next mission, when we should have been out there helping them.
Everything was wonderful.
Just give it time. Everything that happened, just give it a chance.
More and more people are repelled by them nowadays.
- Hi. I just wanted to give you a quick update.
Something's not right here.
We gotta get it. Just make it happen.
But it works.
It works numerically.
She'll show you how things work.
Does it work?
How's it work?
You've forgotten how we do things up here.
Looks like it works.
And give me a hand.
Actually, I could use an extra pair of hands.
You know, this psychic connection thing, it goes both ways and the moment that I walked in here,
How do you know it still works?
And it's gonna work.
Kira, it's working.
I think... I think it still works.
How is this supposed to work?
Don't worry, it works.
How do you know this works?
There's something wrong with it.
Because it ain't working, Mama.
You, give me a hand.
Yeah, well, it's workin'.
Sara Harvey's helping hand.
How does it work with you two?
How's that working out for you?
I can tell you from experience that closure does not come that easily.
Hmm. Speaking of closure, are you punishing yourself for betraying Malcolm?
I don't think you understand how this works.
But then you got her justice, Oliver, and you got me some closure, and I am never going to forget that.
All right, now when Joe gets here we're just going to tell him he needs to lighten up on Brian, and then we'll all talk this thing out so we can move past it.
But still, holy crap!
- You know how this shit works.
I mean, whatever we're doing is working, right?
Happy to help out a fellow Time Master.
- All right, too easy.
You assured me this would work.
Could you use an extra hand?
You know, if you're trying to drive everyone crazy, I have to tell you, it's working.
Now, which would you prefer... bleeding out quickly from a severed artery, or expiring from a paralytic toxin?
- You sure this is gonna work?
I told them to keep us posted. OK. Thanks, Billy.
Uh-oh. Let's hope it works on something else.
Is it working?
Don't tell me you got to check in, as well.
It's probably not the healthiest way of moving on.
Um... My, uh, my mom was, uh... she was in and out of these places, so I know how it works.
Classic BoJack.
What did the Blessed Juana do to deserve canonization?
At times like this, I feel guilty, because I should be thinking about my only true friend:
Now, I have tried to always be there for her, and I have been a very good son, but there is just something wrong with my mother, an... and she does things, and then she blames me,
I'm just here to offer a helping hand.
- I was the only one who could fry the manual controls to make sure this worked and to make sure...
You don't even know if it works.
Please, Rahul... There's nothing you can do to make Morn that angry.
The speech is bullshit, but it works.
I need you to help me out.
Okay, okay, so, is this how this works?
Do you think that's the way this works?
Something's not right.
Hey, hey! - I'm so sick... of your threats to my family!
For it to work, someone has to die.
Apparently, that's the key to making it work.
Maybe it'll work through his system twice as fast.
I need this to work.
- it will work...
Showed smart mouth how we do things around here.
Hey, will you give me a hand with this?
I think the boy could use a drink.
And how is that working out for ya?
-I know. -Okay. -I know how it works.
I won't activate it... now that I know how it works.
Yo, Poussey will lose her shit.
And I like to think I can do better, if we're still on for dinner.
He's still probably in her pocket, but... if it works... maybe we expose Reyes and we get the mistrial you've been praying for.
But, right or wrong, you can't deny that it works.
The circumstances are unfortunate, but each loss brings opportunity.
So, Frank is in prison, and everyone's retreated to their corners, including my bosses, one of whom has repeatedly told me to let it go and move on.
You told me to move on.
How does this all work?
Even if this works, we're never gonna be able to fly out off here.
This is how it works, Lucifer.
I know how this goes.
Hmm. And how's that working out for you?
- You know how these things work.
I wanted it to work.
If you go over to county, maybe they will be processing your mother during visiting hours.
But I was willing to work it for both of us.
Lucy's right, it works.
You guys, are you ever just tired of being alive?
And if it goes well, we'll have more shows, and then Jack will definitely be at those.
I think I'm talking to Dennis.
I just wanna see if it works.
So I started banging her back out.
That and everything that he taught me is real and it works.
So, yeah, if you ever needed a helping hand...
No. No, a helping...
But how do you make it work?
I want to know how it works.
Oh, you know how this works!
Then get somewhere honestly.
You just want me to make good with my FBI agent son so he doesn't go tell them about it and they come close this little science project, and then bam!
But it's only a trap if it works.
Yeah, we will.
You think a song would work?
Did you honestly think you could come in here with your bloody performance art and it would work?
So this is how it works?
That's how money works.
I think we all know how this works by now.
There was this one night... he was gone drinking and we were alone.
Oh, we meet up once a day, fill each other in.
No, it doesn't work that way.
Like, it totally is, but what exactly are you hoping Lex will be able tell us if this works?
You can see how it's working. Yeah.
Jesse, I think he might be trying to help us.
I'm just supposed to keep an eye on you.
We were barely making ends meet as it was.
I'm gonna be sleeping on the street with my family!
I was starting to think you weren't gonna show up again.
- Do you need a hand with these?
Yeah, yeah, it'd use an engine like the ones they have in some helicopters, only it'd run on bio-diesel.
Help out best you can.
But you help me with my adventure, and maybe we can both get everything we want.
Yeah. We are gonna make this work, and we are gonna be happy.
Yeah, and what if they can't?
Thanks for helping us out.
Do you think it will?
I don't know how it works, exactly, but I know that your mom loved you very much.
He knows how we run things around here.
Alright, done.
Best way this works is if we blow up the bridge before the truck gets there so the parentals can run free.
Unh-unh. You are way too fab to be down in the dumps.
Who would stand up a beautiful woman like you?
That means it's working.
Okay. You know how this works.
Anyway, I can't get over this.
I need a hand with these tie-backs for the drapes.
If it works, next bottle's on me.
- Yeah. - We can always use an extra set of hands.
What I saw in there proves the process works.
Well, then he needs to man up and get over it.
But "captain", it works.
- Yeah. That's how business works.
Truth be told, I got a little help from Tilly. - Tilly?
I have some sense, a sickening thrum that there is some kind of malice at work here.
Why don't I just go to Cambulac and take Kublai's head as well?
You're beautiful and fun and smarter than people think, and I know there is zero chance you would ever go out with a guy like me, so I'm gonna let you say no right now, and then we can move on and go back to being friends.
So how does this work?
That's how this world works.
Because the country had to move on.
I've never been a homosexual. - Olivier likes the water, sure! Eventually you have to call a spade a spade, and a gay a gay...
If we get back together, then how does it work?
Coming to give me backup?
I'm just... can I offer you a hand?
How does that even work?
You need to give them closure.
Well, if this works, we could find Hook before the boat leaves.
If there's even a chance that will work, we have to risk it.
How do we know that's gonna work?
Will it definitely work?
Can you give us a hand, please?
That's how it works.
"If this works out"?
How does it work?
You wanna see how it works?
Um... well, if you make this work, I'll do anything for you.
Alec, don't do this out of anger. Jace is still your parabatai.
Keps, I could use another set of hands here.
I've been struggling to make ends meet and you've been living the high life?
He'll be drinking. He'll be drinking, of that I'm certain.
But I don't know how it works down here.
You think you're gonna be able to make that work?
And if it all works out, I'll see you in a few days.
Maybe it'll work on her.
Let his loved ones have some closure.
Yeah, all right. All right, cool.
A contractor who's nervous around tools.
That's not how this works.
But for it to work, we gotta be energy-rich.
Make that system work, it'll make it happen.
Great-uncle Ford, I think it's working!
Liz, it's working.
Anyway, how is it going for you?
How does it work?
♪ Till we shut the lights down ♪ [panting] Well, come on, give me a hand.
- Love at first sight.
General, I'm gonna be blunt.
And anyway... that's not how it works.
Now, I hope, for all your sake... that you get it now that you understand how things work.
We have to help him find a way to move on.
We fell hard and fast, but I want to stand by her.
You need a hand?
Now you give me a hand and we'll stick this up.
It'll not play like that.
I mean... ever since the moment when we saw him at the hospital, there's been something off about him.
That can't possibly work.
No, it does!
Can I give you a hand?
You just want to ram your fingers in your ears, block it all out.
I'll give you a hand, Mrs Moxam.
Drink?
In case you change your mind about helping me out with Harvey Specter.
You better not be reneging on our deal.
Because we did it on a whim.
That's how this works, right?
How does it work?
Because it doesn't stick with these people.
You see how that works?
No. You don't see how that works?
She should move on.
That's the only way that this is going to work.
Need a hand?
It means it's working.
And we'd go out... we'd go out drinking sometimes.
How does it work?
Then it's working.
Fine. Then you can give us a hand.
Guess I could grab a beverage while we're waiting.
That ain't the way this works.
Doc, give us a hand, which one is the transponder?
Sometimes allowing yourself to indulge in memories of a loved one is the best way to get closure.
But Sadie caught you spying in the window, didn't she?
That's how we roll.
- Because that's how society works.
By morning, you'll be as good as new.
I plan on drinking a lot.
- It's the way it works!
Easy peasy lemon squeezy!
That's what I'm talking about.
You wanna come over here and help me with some bags in the fridge?
That's not how this works.
Ah, w... that's Frank for ya.
Maybe vanilla's getting a little old for me.
Turn it off, it worked!
- So how does this work?
Well, how does that even work?
Okay, so the two of you...
Look, I just don't want to give my dad another reason to get pissed off, you guys.
I think if we attach the right talent, this could be a hit.
I understand how this works.
I'm just going to show you a few pictures, and you tell me which ones you like, okay?
What the fuck?
Boys upstairs are getting real sick of you.
Cabracadabra had a killer holiday season and I think New Year's is going to be even bigger.
You're gonna spend a couple days being mad at me, then I'll get you another gig, and you'll be my client again, just like every time.
Typical BoSchwack.
How does that work?
- Oh, nothing. We practically stole it from them.
I know, we practically stole it, right?
Oh, my God, this is so classic Katrina!
You could always choose to move on, Gavin.
Just, like, how it worked.
- now that you've explained how it works.
- She said she was tired.
You want to give me a hand with this?
That's my sister.
And so it goes.
You better learn how it works around here.
How does it work when you do it?
Walter, it's working.
Or a bolt of lightning or a charged particle, like from the Northern Lights.
I mean, we're still on for mani-pedis at lunch, right?
Go give him a hand, Chief.
Mind giving me a hand?
Your life doesn't matter and neither does mine, does it?
In my experience, it's best to be direct and get straight to the point.
It's really... it's really working for me.
Hey, guys, give us a hand with this.
That's how it works.
Wouldn't surprise me if they were packing his bags for Rio as we speak.
While it's working, yes.
It robbed us of the gift of... letting someone else lend a hand, the gift of letting someone you love see you at-at your weakest.
Wanted to give you an update.
Down some Red Eye with us. We're still drinking.
I've got to be careful.
Okay, I gotta tell you, that works.
It's really corny, but it totally works.
You better not be standing me up, Captain.
I'm giving you a helping hand.
You're about to get married, ain't you?
Shouldn't bygones be bygones?
Why not use a celebration such as this, the investiture of a new sovereign, a beautiful young child, symbol of modernity, change and progress, to turn a page?
Come on, you know how this goes.
We just decided, you know, spur of the moment, to hit the road process and heal...
Hey, it's working!
Fluorescing bones, got it.
Look, you know how this works, Alex.
- I can't believe this is working.
I think it's working.
If we succeed, yes.
Ohm. Ohm getting tired of meditating, but I think it's working.
Maybe that pans out, maybe it doesn't.
- I think we should lead from the start.
Factuopartisviventia. I think it's working.
Okay, I was gonna say "Stay hydrated," but that works too.
Oh, you know how it works.
Look, I'll tell you how it works.
Working like a charm!
Something isn't right.
Yeah, well, it works the other way, too.
Bernie, you know how this works.
I mean, how does this even work?
Yeah, but how does that work, anyway?
Do you know how this works I mean, on the other side?
I'll make the Blaine situation work.
So, how do we do this?
All right.
Well, hopefully it works.
Telling the truth works.
And if something doesn't fit together it will form a dissonance.
Uh, tell me, how did this work?
Of course it works.
What if it works?
Then it works.
Let me cut to the chase.
I don't know what's going on at all with any of the case and I just kind of wanted to stay in the loop, if that was all right.
How is it going?
You were right. It won't work over the phone.
All of those facts are completely at odds with your assertion that Sabine chose the restaurant on the spur of the moment that evening.
There was no spur- of-the-moment choice.
Now I just need to make it happen.
Gaston, I want to help you move on.
Hey, try doing that hanging upside down.
I got to make this work this time, Hank, I really do.
Okay, if this works, the bleeding should slow immediately and BP will rise.
I'm gonna go post up.
You remember that do-it-yourself project that I came over to help you with, when you put up the new drywall in your basement?
Possibly. But you know how this works,
Borrelli, give me a hand over here.
Herrmann, give me a hand.
As long as there's good people in this world willing to step up and lend a hand.
Commander sent me over to help out with this mess.
Did something in the file catch your attention, and you told yourself you were probably overreacting?
Let's hope this works.
- Hold still and hope this works.
REX: I could really use a hand over here.
How it works is is most counties will only allow for a certain limited number of foster care contracts to go to for-profit companies, so how a company like Arbiter gets around it is that they create non-profit companies who get the contracts
That's the only way it would work.
Make this happen.
That is not how it is done.
And how is it done, Abby?
Because if they do, I'm just gonna be a punch line between now and December.
I just want to accept what I did... and move on.
I think Dark Army could be cleaning house.
Look, this whole, slow roll that you and the rest of us have been working up, it didn't work.
Are you sure it'll work on her?
Yes, Mother, I know how it works.
Put your clothes on, I need a hand.
Can you give me a hand over here?
That's got Adam written all over it.
We all understand how it works.
The whole cover story they made up-- shadowing your unit, seeing how you do things, why you've had the success you've had-- it worked, because it's the truth.
I totally understand if you feel like I've ruined whatever chance we have of making it work because of my assignment, but, look, I really like it here, and a big part of that, the biggest part of that,
Okay, that works.
You didn't break out of prison just because your old man was kicking the bucket.
This playful arrogance of yours, Marty, it really works for you.
Alone works.
He's using me to get under your skin, and it's working.
You'd think, but that's not how the bigger man works.
Somebody named Olga should be salting me like a pretzel!
- Yeah, you got it.
That's just a framed toupee on the wall and it friggin' works.
You should keep an emergency stash for people who just got dumped.
Screw that. There should be a whole truck for people who just got dumped.
A truck that caters to girls who just got dumped.
Only if it works.
Pride, I wanted to keep you in the loop, but...
Who the hell do you think you are, keeping me out of the loop, not following protocol?
We were stupid to think it'd work.
Something's not right.
Yeah, it actually works.
I don't know how this works.
So... that's how it works.
I want to make this work.
Yeah. Okay.
I'm sorry if that seems blunt, but, hey... I'm a straight shooter.
Well, let's get drunk and not think about this ever again.
- I must've just gotten tired last night and I didn't finish.
I think we should loop 'em in, you know, being REACT.
Is it working?
Susan's on record in several news publications saying she and John went to the justice of the peace on a whim just before his first deployment in 2006.
I just thought, well, I can do this for as long as it works.
Stood up at a diner.
Or stood up.
I just hope it works.
-Oh. -So, you know how this works?
It could be great, and you deserve that.
You go through me to get to him. The system works.
-Turning the page.
You're just out. That's how it works!
Well, it's a town thing, and I thought you should know,
You set it up, and I went along, and that's how it works.
Let you know how it goes?
Give them the money. He's getting tired up there, I can sense it.
How's it work, anyway?
And it's working, too.
That's just how it is in Josh's culture.
But when I get back, I want to talk about the most boring, normal things in the world, deal?
And you better watch your back, Kayla, because you're next.
You may have a handle on, uh, military ethics, Professor, but I come from the school of whatever works.
And this works.
It's a difficult time, so I'll cut to the chase.
It's not the model I would have used, and it needed to be tightened, but works fine.
How does that work?
- how that works?
I know how it works.
Female docs, too, if it works.
You sensed that I was making an extra effort to make things work with you.
- Can I help you with that?
If they want to bring this in, it's going to get in.
Plus there's no promise that this would work.
Something seems to be working.
You really are turning over a new leaf.
Uh, can you get me up to speed?
He took him across country, thought he could take my boy from me and that I would just roll over.
Ryan. Need a little help, son.
Seo-yeon.
If you mean Hercutel still gets to rape the land with impunity... uh, sorry, extract precious minerals... then, yeah, it works out for them.
We want this to work.
I just suggest we find a way to make this work.
Ordinarily, I wouldn't, but this guy, he stood out.
Daphne, I've given you some medicine to help your blood clot, so I'm just going to apply pressure and wait for it to work.
I'm sorry, that could never catch on.
So... maybe two, new improved people could make it work this time.
Yeah, all right.
They didn't realize they were drinking cat pee?
Of course. Vintage Shane.
One of these days, I may help you.
They deserve closure,
I don't need to watch myself, Harvey.
Let's go.
Look, why don't we just cut to the chase and call this what it really is. Okay.
Did you really think that was going to work?
Ugh. Someone has a friend crush.
See how it works?
don't call me Becky unless you're riding me like a horse.
Yes, it is.
They'll all deliver. It's how it works.
It'll be day to day to see if it works, but...
I didn't think it would work, but...
And if it does, you're going to lead us right to him.
And you might bend your feelings a little bit.
The only way this might work is...
Mouch, can you keep me updated on the polling predictions?
It's how it works.
...or if it might actually be healing.
I told him to let me know how it goes, so I'm just waiting for a text.
- You sure that thing works?
Just because you never took it out of the box doesn't mean it works.
You try to figure out which cute boy has a crush on you.
Your crush loves pizza.
Wait, how-how does that work?
Army plumbers ready to lend a hand.
Sly, can you help us out here?
Good, 'cause the guards here might be passed out but no way an alarm wasn't tripped to Steelson headquarters.
How does that work?
It's the only way this works, Andrew.
So how does this work?
I can't keep giving a shit forever like everyone else around here.
I stayed in that grief until there was a point where I understood I had to... give up the ghost, so to speak, or...
- I'll help.
We were going to make it work, I swear to you.
- Just... if the words "he unbuttoned my" comes out of your mouth,
I-I hope it happens for you.
Guys, if Jenna was working with Rollins and she just found out what we did she could be grooming Sara to become her new seeing-eye dog.
I was thinking, maybe they could give us a hand with Amara, you know, with Cass.
How does it work?
Well, if at first you don't succeed...
That's how you know it's working.
